The book is also useful to professional programmersmaking the transition to Java and object-oriented programming.The book takes an ``objects first'' approach to programming andproblem solving.  It assumes no previous programming experience andrequires no prior knowledge of Java or object-oriented programming.\section*{What's New in the Second Edition?}\noindent The second edition has the following substantive changes:\begin{BL}\item {\bf Unified Modeling Language (UML).} UML diagrams have beenincorporated throughout the text to help illustrate object-orientedconcepts and to describe the design of the Java programs wedevelop. Some of the UML diagrams replace diagrams used in the firstedition, but many new diagrams have been introduced as well.\noindent\hspace*{1pc}UML is rapidly developing into an industry standard for designingobject-oriented programs. So it will be useful for students to befamiliar with it.  But the main reason for incorporating UML is apedagogical one: It makes it easier to present and teachobject-oriented concepts such as information hiding, inheritance, andpolymorphism.\item {\bf Emphasis on Object-Oriented Design.} The second editionplaces somewhat more emphasis on object-oriented design, mostlythrough the way examples are developed. Many of the programmingexamples were rewritten to focus on the design before getting into theJava coding details. This approach was greatly aided by the use of UMLdiagrams.\item {\bf Organizational Changes.} Based on suggestions from reviewersand users of the first edition, several chapters were reorganized. Thefirst two chapters were extensively revised. Chapter 0 now provides amore detailed overview of object orientation and introduces the mainfeatures of UML. This should help orient the student before gettinginto the discussion of Java's implementation of object-oriented concepts.To underscore theimportance of design versus coding,  Chapter 1 has been reorganized to focus on program design anddevelopment before introducing any Java code. It also includes a concise overviewof some of the basic Java language features.  Thus, thestudent has been presented with a good bit of overview materialbefore we begin looking at specific Java examples.\noindent In terms of the organization of Java language elements, discussion ofthe {\tt switch} statement was moved to Chapter 3, where it is coveredalong with the other selection-control structures. Chapter 11``Exceptions'' was reorganized so that it can more easily be used muchearlier in the course.\end{BL}\section*{Why Start with Objects?}\noindent {\it Java, Java, Java} takes an ``objects early'' approach to teachingJava, with the assumption that teaching beginners the ``big picture''early gives them more time to master the principles of object-orientedprogramming.The first time I taught Java in our CS1 course, I followed the sameapproach I had been taking in teaching C and C++---namely, startwith the basic language features and structured programming conceptsand then, somewhere around midterm, introduce object orientation.This approach was familiar, for it was one taken in most ofthe textbooks then available in both Java and C++.One problem with this approach was that many students failed to getthe big picture.   They could understand loops, if-else constructs,and arithmetic expressions, but they had difficulty decomposing aprogramming problem into a well-organized Java program.  Also, itseemed that this procedural approach failed to take advantage of thestrengths of Java's object orientation.  Why teach an object-orientedlanguage if you're going to treat it like C or Pascal?I was reminded of a similar situation that existed when Pascal was thepredominant CS1 language.  Back then the main hurdle for beginners was{\it procedural abstraction}---learning the basic mechanismsof procedure call and parameter passing and learning how to {\bfdesign} programs as a collection of procedures.  {\it Oh! Pascal!},my favorite introductory text, was typical of a ``procedures early''approach.  It covered procedures and parameters in Chapter 2, rightafter covering the assignment and I/O constructs in Chapter 1. It thencovered program design and organization in Chapter 3. It didn't getinto loops, if-else, and other structured programming concepts untilChapter 4 and beyond.Presently, the main hurdle for beginners is {\it objectabstraction}. Beginning programmers must be able to see a program as acollection of interacting objects and must learn how to decomposeprogramming problems into well-designed objects.   Object orientationsubsumes both procedural abstraction and structured programmingconcepts from the Pascal days.   Teaching ``objects early'' takes atop-down approach to these three important concepts.   The sooner youbegin to introduce objects and classes, the better the chances thatstudents will master the important principles of object orientation.Object orientation (OO) is a fundamental problem-solving and designconcept, not just another language detail that should be relegated tothe middle or the end of the book (or course).  If OO concepts areintroduced late, it is much too easy to skip over them when push comesto shove in the course.Java is a good language for introducing object orientation.  Its objectmodel is better organized than C++. In C++, it is easy to ``workaround'' or completely ignore OO features and treat the language likeC.~In Java, there are good opportunities for motivating the discussionof object orientation.  For example, it's almost impossible to discussapplets without discussing inheritance and polymorphism.  Thus, ratherthan using contrived examples of OO concepts, instructors can use someof Java's basic features---applets, the class library, GUIcomponents---to motivate these discussions in a natural way.\vspace{7pt}\section*{Key Features}\noindent In addition to its ``objects early'' approach, this book has severalother important features.\begin{BL}\item {\bf Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams.} More than 225UML diagrams have been incorporated throughout the text to explainobject-oriented concepts and to focus on object-oriented design.  Theadvantages of using UML are several. First, UML diagrams provide aconcise visual means of describing the main features of classes andobjects. In one glance you can see an object's attributes and methods,whether they are private or public, and how the class or objectrelates to other classes. Second, UML diagrams provide simplegraphical models for important object-oriented concepts such asinheritance and polymorphism. A picture is worth 1,000 words, so inaddition to the descriptions provided in words, the UML diagramsshould help students learn these important concepts. Third, for thepurposes for which it is used in this book, UML is relatively easy andintuitive to understand. The basic notation is introduced in Chapter 0through simple, accessible examples. Finally, UML is rapidly becomingan industry standard. So gaining familiarity with UML in this bookwill make other books on Java or object-oriented design moreaccessible.\item  {\bf The {\tt CyberPet} Example.} Throughout the text a {\ttCyberPet} class is used as a running example to motivate andillustrate important concepts.  The {\tt CyberPet} is introduced inChapter 2, as a way of ``anthropomorphizing'' the basic features ofobjects.   Thus, individual {\tt CyberPet}s belong to a class(definition), have a certain state (instance variables), and arecapable of certain behaviors like eating and sleeping (instancemethods). Method calls are used to command the {\tt CyberPet}s toeat and sleep.   In Chapter 3 the emphasis is on defining and usingmethods and parameters to promote communication with {\tt CyberPet}s.In subsequent chapters, concepts such as inheritance, randomness,animation, and threads are illustrated in terms of the {\tt CyberPet}.Some of the lab and programming exercises are also centered aroundextending the behavior and sophistication of the {\tt CyberPet}.\item  {\bf Applets and GUIs.} Applets and GUIs are first introduced inChapter 4 and then used throughout the rest of the text.  Clearly,applets are a ``turn-on'' for introductory students and can be used asa good motivating factor.  Plus, {\it event-driven programming} andGraphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are what students ought now to belearning in CS1. We are long past the days when command-lineinterfaces were the norm in applications programming.   Another nicething about Java applets is that they are fundamentallyobject oriented.  To understand them fully, students need to understandbasic OO concepts.   That's why applets are not introduced untilChapter 4, where they provide an excellent way to motivate thediscussion of inheritance and polymorphism.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf Companion Web Site.} The text is designed to be used inconjunction with a companion Web site that includes many usefulresources, including the Java code and Java documentation (in HTML) forall the examples in the text, additional lab and programmingassignments, online quizzes that can be scored automatically,and PowerPoint class notes.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf Problem-Solving Approach.} A pedagogical, problem-solvingapproach is taken throughout the text.  There are a total of 13 fullydeveloped case studies, as well as numerous other examples thatillustrate the problem-solving process.   Marginal notes in the textrepeatedly emphasize the basic elements of object-oriented problemsolving: What objects do we need? What methods and data do we need?What algorithm should we use? And so on.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf Self-Study Exercises.} The book contains more than 200self-study exercises, with answers provided at the back of eachchapter.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf End-of-Chapter Exercises.} Over 400 end-of-chapter exercisesare provided, including ``Challenge'' exercises at the end of mostsets.  The answers are provided in an Instructor's Manual, which is availableto adopters.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf Programming, Debugging, and Design Tips.} The book containsnearly 400 separately identified ``tips'' (Programming Tips, DebuggingTips, Effective Design Principles, and Java Language Rules) thatprovide useful programming and design information in anutshell.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf Hands-On Learning Sections.} Each chapter concludes with alaboratory exercise, so the text can easily be used to supportlab-based CS1 courses. For CS1 courses that are notlab based, these sections can still be read as preparation for aprogramming assignment, or as an in-class demo, or as some other form of hands-on exercise. For each lab in the text, the companion Website contains additional resources and handouts, as well as arepository of alternative lab assignments.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf ``From the Library'' Sections.} Each chapter includes a sectionthat introduces one or more of the library classes from the Java API(Application Programming Interface).  In the early chapters, thesesections provide a way of introducing tools, such as I/O classes andmethods, needed to write simple programs.  In subsequent chapters, someof these sections introduce useful but optional topics, such as the{\tt NumberFormat} class used to format numeric output.  Others introducebasic GUI (Graphical User Interface) components that are used inprogram examples and the laboratory sections.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf ``Object-Oriented Design'' Sections.} Each chapter includes asection on object-oriented design, which is used to underscore andamplify important principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, andinformation hiding. For instructors wishing to emphasizeobject-oriented design, Table~1 provides a list ofsections that should be covered.\vspace{3pt}\item  {\bf ``Java Language Summary''.} Those chapters that introducelanguage features contain ``Java Language Summary'' sections thatsummarize the features' essential syntax and semantics.\end{BL}\begin{table}[tb]%\hphantom{\caption{An overview of object-oriented sections.}\label{tab-ood}}\TBT{0.5pc}{An overview of object-oriented sections.}\begin{tabular}{ll} \multicolumn{2}{l}{\color{cyan}\rule{26pc}{1pt}}\\[2pt]\TBCH{Topic}                  & \TBCH{Section} \\[-4pt]\multicolumn{2}{l}{\color{cyan}\rule{26pc}{0.5pt}}\\[2pt]What Is Object Orientation?                       &  Chapter 0.7\\Overview of UML                                  &  Chapter 0.8\\Object-Oriented Design Process                   &  Chapter 1.2\\Objects: Defining, Creating, Using               &  Chapter 2\\Methods: Communicating with Objects              &  Chapter 3\\Inheritance: The {\tt toString()} Method         & Chapter 3, OOD\\Inheritance and Polymorphism in Applets          & Chapter 4.2-4.4\\Inheritance and Polymorphism: {\tt ToggleButton} & Chapter 4, OOD\\Information Hiding                               & Chapter 5, OOD\\Structured Programming Concepts                  & Chapter 6, OOD\\Abstract Classes: {\tt Cipher}                   & Chapter 7, OOD\\Polymorphism: Polymorphic Sorting                & Chapter 8, OOD\\Model-View-Controller Architecture               & Chapter 9, OOD\\Inheritance and Polymorphism: Spider/Fly Classes \hspace*{1pc}& Chapter 13.6\\Generic Client/Server Classes                    & Chapter 15.7\\Abstract Data Types: {\tt List} Class            & Chapter 16, OOD\\[-4pt]\multicolumn{2}{l}{\color{cyan}\rule{26pc}{1pt}}\end{tabular}\endTB\vspace{-9pt}\end{table}\section*{Organization of the Text}\noindent The book is organized into three main parts.  The first part (Chapters0 through 4) introduces the basic concepts of object orientation,including objects, classes, methods, parameter passing, informationhiding, inheritance, and polymorphism.   Although the primary focus inthese chapters is on object orientation rather than on Java languagedetails, each of these chapters has a ``Java Language Summary'' sectionthat summarizes the language elements introduced.In Chapters 1 to 3, students are given the basic building blocks forconstructing a Java program from scratch.  Although the programs atthis stage have limited functionality in terms of control structuresand data types, the priority is placed on how objects are constructedand how they interact with each other through method calls andparameter passing.The second part (Chapters 5 through 8) focuses on the remaininglanguage elements, including data types and operators (Chapter 5),control structures (Chapter 6), strings (Chapter 7), and arrays(Chapter 8).  Once the basic structure and framework of anobject-oriented program are understood, it is relatively easy tointroduce these language features.Part Three (Chapters 9 through 16) covers a variety of advancedtopics, including Graphical User Interfaces (Chapter 9), graphics(Chapter 10), exceptions (Chapter 11), recursion (Chapter 12), threads(Chapter 13), files (Chapter 14), sockets (Chapter 15), and datastructures (Chapter 16). Topics from these chapters can be usedselectively depending on instructor and student interest.Table 2 provides an example syllabus from my %<tab_syllabus1>one-semester CS1 course.  Our semester is 13 weeks (plus one readingweek during which classes do not meet).\splarge Note that the advanced topic chapters needn't be covered inorder.  Recursion (Chapter 12) could be introduced at the same time oreven before loops (Chapter 6). The recursion chapter includes examplesusing strings, arrays,  and  drawing  algorithms  (fractals),  \spnormallar\begin{table}[htb]%%\hphantom{\caption{A one-semester course.}\label{tab-course}}\TBT{3.5pc}{A one-semester course.}\hspace*{3pc}\begin{tabular}{lll}\multicolumn{3}{l}{\color{cyan}\rule{20pc}{1pt}}\\[2pt]\TBCH{Weeks} & \TBCH{Topics}                  & \TBCH{Chapters} \\[-4pt]\multicolumn{3}{l}{\color{cyan}\rule{20pc}{0.5pt}}\\[2pt]   1           & Object Orientation, UML         &  Chapter 0\\               & Program Design and Development  &  Chapter 1\\   2--4        & Objects and Class Definitions &  Chapter 2  \\               & Methods and Parameters        &  Chapter 3  \\               & Selection Structure (if-else) &             \\   5           & Applet Programming            &  Chapter 4  \\               & Inheritance                   &             \\   6           & Data Types and Operators      &  Chapter 5  \\   7--8        & Control Structures (Loops)    &  Chapter 6  \\               & Structured Programming        &             \\   9           & String Processing (loops)     &  Chapter 7  \\   10          & Array Processing              &  Chapter 8  \\   11          & Recursion                     &  Chapter 12 \\   12          & Advanced Topic (GUIs)         &  Chapter 9  \\   13          & Advanced Topic (Exceptions)   &  Chapter 11 \\               & Advanced Topic (Threads)      &  Chapter 13     \\[-4pt]\multicolumn{3}{l}{\color{cyan}\rule{20pc}{1pt}}\end{tabular}\endTB\vspace{-6pt}\end{table}%as  well  as some standard numerical algorithms (factorial). Another way to teachrecursion would be to incorporate it into the discussion of strings(Chapter 7), arrays (Chapter~8), and graphics (Chapter 10), therebytreating iteration and recursion in parallel.Exceptions (Chapter 11) could also be covered earlier.  The examples inthe first few sections of this chapter use simple arithmeticoperations and the basic for loop.  If these language elements areintroduced separately, then exceptions could be covered right afterChapter 3.Some of the examples in the advanced chapters use applets (Chapter~4)and GUIs (Chapter 9), so these chapters should ideally be coveredbefore Chapters 10 (graphics), 13 (threads), 14 (files), and 15(sockets and networking).  However, Chapter 16 (data structures) andsections of the other advanced topic chapters can be coveredindependently of applets and GUIs.

These includeChristian Allen, Jeff Green, Ryan Carmody, and Michael Wilson.  I especiallywant to thank Jamie Mazur, whose feedback on the manuscript and enthusiasmfor the objects-first approach and whose role in developing the solutionsmanual were much appreciated. My thanks to the following list of individuals who helped identify errors in the first edition: Ashton Hobbs, Elissa Lowe, Peter Casey, Bernd Bruegge, David Mix Barrington,Rommy Mayerowitz, Jason Smart, Colleen Kubont, Jonathan Amery, Shakira Ramos, Jennifer Chen, Robert Gaspar, Yolanda McManus, andJim Parry.Thanks to my colleague Joe Palladino in the Engineering Department,who served as the La\TeX\ meister throughout the project; to ChuckLiang in the Computer Science Department for interesting Javaexamples; and to my good Hawaii friend and limerick meister, LanningLee.To my Trinity computer science colleagues, Madalene Spezialetti andRalph Walde, thanks for their generous support and advice, especiallyduring the early stages of this project.  They're the ones who pulledme back over the rail when I went overboard with the ``objects first''juggernaut.  They also helped rescue CyberPet from its germ as a(lame!) horse.  With their conjurings and refinements it evolvedthrough a dog, a parrot, and then a ``net pet,'' before settling,rather nicely we think, as CyberPet.  They also have my gratitude forbeing willing to subject our students to earlier (incomplete) draftsof the manuscript in their sections of our intro course.  Madalene'ssuggestion to emphasize basic language features early led eventuallyto the book's ``Java Language Summary'' sections.  She also took thefirst pass at drafting material that appears in Chapter 0 and 1.Although that material has been rewritten (and whatever flaws it hasare entirely mine), it still bears the stamp of her influence.  Theircriticisms and suggestions have improved the text in immeasurable andsignificant ways, and the gentleness, subtleness, and humor with whichthey delivered their suggestions have helped sustain our friendship.Finally, thanks to my wife, Choong Lan How, for her love andencouragement, and for her careful reading of the first threechapters; to my daughter Alicia for her feedback on artistic matters;and to my daughter Meisha for her tremendous help in producing thesolutions manual and the on-line study guide.\clearpage\thispagestyle{plain}\markboth{\fontRHch\color{cyan}Brief
