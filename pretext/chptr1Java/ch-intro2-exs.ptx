      and her daughter weighing 165 pounds,
      were trapped in a very high tower.
      Outside their window was a pulley and rope with a basket fastened on each end.
      They managed to escape by using the baskets and a 75-pound weight they found in the tower.
      How did they do it?
      The problem is that anytime the difference in weight between the two baskets is more than 15 pounds,
      someone might get hurt.
      Describe an algorithm that gets them down safely.

      <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term> Here's another Carroll favorite: A farmer needs to cross a river with his fox, goose,
      and a bag of corn.
      There's a rowboat that will hold the farmer and one other passenger.
      The problem is that the fox will eat the goose if they are left alone on the river bank,
      and the goose will eat the corn if they are left alone on the river bank.
      Write an algorithm that describes how he got across without losing any of his possessions.

      <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term> Have you heard this one?
      A farmer lent the mechanic next door a 40-pound weight.
      Unfortunately,
      the mechanic dropped the weight and it broke into four pieces. The good news is that,
      according to the mechanic,
      it is still possible to use the four pieces to weigh any quantity between one 
      40 pounds on a balance scale. How much did each of the four pieces weigh? 
      (<em>Hint</em>: You can weigh a 4-pound object on a balance by putting a 5-pound 
      weight on one side and a 1-pound weight on the other.)

	Suppose your little sister asks you to show her how to use a

	A Caesar cipher is a secret code in which each letter of the alphabet is shifted by
	<em>N</em> letters to the right,
	with the letters at the end of the alphabet wrapping around to the beginning.
	For example,
	if <em>N</em> is 1, when we shift each letter to the right,
	the word <em>daze</em> would be written as <em>ebaf</em>.
	Note that the <em>z</em> has wrapped around to the beginning of the alphabet.
	Describe an algorithm that can be used to create a Caesar encoded message with a shift of 5.

	Suppose you received the message,
	<q>sxccohv duh ixq,</q>

	Suppose you're talking to your little brother on the phone and he wants you to calculate his homework average.
	All you have to work with is a piece of chalk and a very small chalkboard<mdash/>big enough to write one four-digit number.
	What's more,
	although your little brother knows how to read numbers,
	he doesn't know how to count very well so he can't tell you how many grades there are.
	All he can do is read the numbers to you.
	Describe an algorithm that will calculate the correct average under these conditions.

      <p><term>Challenge:</term> Define a class named <c>TaxWhiz</c> that computes the sales tax for a purchase.
      It should store the current tax rate as an instance variable.
      Following the model of the <c>Riddle</c> class,
      you can initialize the rate using a <c>TaxWhiz()</c> constructor.
      This class should have one <c>public</c> method, <c>calcTax(double purchase)</c>, 
      which will <c>return</c> a <c>double</c>, whose value is <c>purchases</c> times the tax rate.
      For example, if the tax rate is 4 percent, 0.04, and the purchase is $100,
      then <c>calcTax()</c> should return 4.0.

	Draw a UML class diagram representing the following class: The name of the class is <c>Circle</c>. It has one attribute,
	a <c>radius</c> that is represented by a <c>double</c> value.
	It has one operation, <c>calculateArea()</c>, which 
	returns a <c>double</c>. Its attributes should be designated as private and its method as public.

	To represent a triangle we need attributes for each of its three sides and operations to create a triangle,
	calculate its area, and calculate its perimeter.
	Draw a UML diagram to represent this triangle.
