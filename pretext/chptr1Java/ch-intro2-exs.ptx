      <statement>
      <p><term>Puzzle Problem:</term> Here's another Carroll favorite:
      A farmer needs to cross a river with a fox, a goose,
      and a bag of corn.
      There's a rowboat that will hold the farmer and one other passenger.
      The problem is that the fox will eat the goose if they are left alone on the river bank,
      and the goose will eat the corn if they are left alone on the river bank.
      Write an algorithm that describes how they got all across
      without any losses. One last constraint is that the animals
      don't like to stay still; so, prioritize getting the animals to
      the other side before the corn, if possible.

	<title>Tax Whiz Challenge</title>
    <statement>
      <p><term>Challenge:</term> Define a class named <c>TaxWhiz</c> that computes the sales tax for a purchase.
      It should store the current tax rate as an instance variable.
      Following the model of the <c>Riddle</c> class,
      you can initialize the rate using a <c>TaxWhiz()</c> constructor.
      This class should have one <c>public</c> method, <c>calcTax(double purchase)</c>, 
      which will <c>return</c> a <c>double</c>, whose value is <c>purchases</c> times the tax rate.
      For example, if the tax rate is 4 percent, 0.04, and the purchase is $100,
      then <c>calcTax()</c> should return 4.0.
