  <title>Recursive Definition</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      One place you might have already seen recursion is in mathematics.
      A <term>recursive definition</term>
          <idx><h>recursive definition</h></idx>
      consists of two parts: a recursive part in which the
      <em>n</em>th value is defined in terms of the <m>(n-1)</m>st value,
      and a nonrecursive,
      <em>boundary</em> or <term>base case</term>,
      which defines a limiting condition.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Factorial: <em>N</em>!</title>
    <p>
      For example, consider the problem of calculating the factorial
          <idx><h>factorial</h></idx>
      of <em>n</em><mdash/>that is,
      <em>n</em>! for <m>n \geq 0</m>.
      As you may recall, <em>n</em>! is calculated as follows:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1, for n > 0
 </input></program>
    <p>
      In addition, 0! is defined as 1.
      Let's now look at some examples for different values of <em>n</em>:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
2! = 2 * 1 = 2
1! = 1
0! = 1
 </input></program>
    <p>
      As these examples suggest,
      <em>n</em>! can always be calculated in terms of <m>(n-1)</m>!
      This relationship might be clearer if we rewrite the previous calculations as follows:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4 * 3! = 24
3! = 3 * 2 * 1     = 3 * 2! = 6
2! = 2 * 1         = 2 * 1! = 2
1!                 = 1 * 0! = 1
0!                 = 1
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The only case in which we can't calculate
      <em>n</em>! in terms of <m>(n-1)</m>! is when <em>n</em> is 0.
      Otherwise, in each case we see that
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
n! = n * (n-1)!
 </input></program>
    <p>
      This leads to the following recursive definition:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
n! = 1          if n = 0    // Boundary (or base) case
n! = n * (n-1)! if n > 0    // Recursive case
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Note that if we had omitted the base case,
      the recursion would have continued to <m>(-1)</m>! and <m>(-2)</m>! and so on.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Bounding the Repetition</title>
      <p>
        An infinite repetition will result if a recursive definition is not properly bounded.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      The recursive<idx><h>recursion,
      recursive case</h></idx> case uses divide and conquer to break the problem into a smaller problem,
      but the smaller problem is just a smaller version of the original problem.
      This combination of self-similarity and divide and conquer is what characterizes recursion.
      The base
          <idx><h>recursion, base case</h></idx>
      case is used to stop or limit the recursion.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Recursive Definition</title>
      <p>
        For recursive algorithms and definitions,
        the base case serves as the bound for the algorithm.
        The <term>recursive case</term>
            <idx><h>recursive case</h></idx>
        defines the <term>n</term>th case in terms of the <m>(n-1)</m>st case.
      </p>
    </principle>

  <subsection xml:id="sec-boxes">
    <title>Drawing a Nested Pattern</title>
    <p>
      As another example,
      consider the problem of drawing the nested boxes pattern in <xref ref="fig-boxes">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-boxes">
    <caption>Nested boxes.</caption>
    <image width="40%" source="chptr12/boxes.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The self-similarity occurs in the fact that for this pattern,
      its parts resemble the whole.
      The basic shape involved is a square,
      which is repeated over and over at an ever-smaller scale.
      A recursive definition for this pattern would be
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
Base case:      if side &lt; 5 do nothing
Recursive case: if side >= 5
                  draw a square
                  decrease the side and draw a smaller
                             pattern inside the square
 </input></program> 
    <p>
      This definition uses the length of the square's side to help define the pattern.
      If the length of the side is greater than or equal to 5, draw a square with dimensions <m>side \times side</m>.
      Then decrease the length of the side and draw a smaller version of the pattern inside that square.
      In this case, the <em>side</em>
      variable will decrease at each level of the drawing.
      When the length of the side becomes less than 5, the recursion stops.
      Thus, the length of the side serves as the limit or bound for this algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should note that the length of the side functions here like a parameter in a method 
      definition: It provides essential information for the definition,
      just as a method parameter provides essential data to the method.
      Indeed, this is exactly the role that parameters play in recursive methods.
      They provide essential information that determines the method's behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-nestedbox">Figure</xref> illustrates how we would apply the definition.
      Suppose the side starts out at 20 and decreases by 5 at each level of recursion.
      Note that as you move from top to bottom across the four patterns,
      each pattern contains the one below it.
      A <c>nestedBoxes(20)</c> can be drawn by first drawing a
      <m>20 \times 20</m> square and then drawing a <c>nestedBoxes(15)</c> pattern inside it.
      Similarly, a <c>nestedBoxes(15)</c> can be drawn by first drawing a
      <m>15 \times 15</m> square and then drawing a <c>nestedBoxes(10)</c> pattern inside it.
      And so on.

     of 20 and decreasing the side by 5 each time.</caption>
     </figure>
     <p>
      These examples illustrate the power of recursion
          <idx><h>recursion</h></idx>
      as a problem-solving technique for situations that involve repetition.
      Like the iterative (looping) control structures we studied in Chapter<nbsp/>6,
      recursion is used to implement repetition within a bound.
      For recursive algorithms, the bound is defined by the base case,
      whereas for loops,
      the bound is defined by the loop's entry condition.
      In either case, repetition stops when the bound is reached.
    </p>
     <principle>
              <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Infinite Recursion</title>
              <p>
                An unbounded or incorrectly bounded recursive algorithm will lead to infinite repetition.
                Care must be taken to get the bound right.
