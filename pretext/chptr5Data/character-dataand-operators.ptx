  <title>Character Data and Operators</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Another primitive data type in Java is the character type,
<c>char</c>.
          <idx><h>char</h></idx>
      A character in Java is represented by a 16-bit
      <em>unsigned</em> integer.
      This means that a total of <m>2^{16}</m> or 65536  different Unicode characters can be represented,
      corresponding to the integer values 0 to 65535.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>Unicode</term> character set is an international standard that has 
      been developed to enable computer languages to represent characters in a wide variety of languages,
      not just English. (See <url href="http://www.unicode.org/" visual="">http://www.unicode.org/</url> for
      detailed information.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is customary in programming languages to use unsigned integers to represent characters.
      This means that all the digits (<m>0, \dots,9</m>),
      alphabetic letters (<m>a,\dots,z, A,\dots, Z</m>), punctuation symbols
      (such as . ; , `` `' ! _ -),
      and nonprinting control characters (LINE_FEED, ESCAPE, CARRIAGE_RETURN, 
      <m>\dots</m>) that make up the computer's character set are 
      represented in the computer's memory by integers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more traditional set of characters is the
      <em>ASCII (American Standard  Code for Information Interchange)</em> character set.
      <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" visual="">ASCII</url> is based on 
      a 7-bit code and, therefore,
      defines <m>2^7</m> or 128 different characters,
      corresponding to the integer values 0 to 127.
      In order to make Unicode backward compatible with ASCII systems, 
      the first 128 Unicode characters are identical to the ASCII characters.
      Thus, in both the ASCII and Unicode encoding,
      the printable characters have the integer values shown in 
      <xref ref="fig-ASCII">Figure</xref>.

    <title>Character to Integer Conversions</title>
    <p>
      Is <sq>A</sq> a character or an integer?
      The fact that character data are stored as integers in the computer's 
      memory can cause some confusion about whether a given piece of data is a character or an integer.
      In other words, when is a character, for example <sq>A</sq>,
      treated as the integer (65) instead of as the character <sq>A</sq>?
      The rule in Java is that a character literal <mdash/> <sq>a</sq> or <sq>A</sq> or 
      <sq>0</sq> or <sq>?</sq> <mdash/> is always treated as a character,
      unless we explicitly tell Java to treat it as  an integer.
      So if we display a literal's value
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
     System.out.println('a');
    </input></program>
    <p>
      the letter <sq>a</sq> will be displayed.
      Similarly, if we assign <sq>a</sq> to a
      <c>char</c> variable and then display the variable's value,
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      char ch = 'a';
      System.out.println(ch);         // Displays 'a'
    </input></program>
    <p>
      the letter <sq>a</sq> will be shown.
      If, on the other hand, we wish to output a character's integer value,
      we must use an explicit cast operator as follows:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
     System.out.println((int)'a') ;   // Displays 97
    </input></program>
    <p>
      A <term>cast operation</term>,
      such as <c>(int)</c>, converts one type of data ('a') into another (97).
      This is known as a <term>type conversion</term>.
      Similarly, if we wish to store a character's integer value in a variable,
      we can <em>cast</em> the <c>char</c> into an <c>int</c> as follows:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      int k = (int)'a';       // Converts 'a' to 97
      System.out.println(k);  // Displays 97
    </input></program>
    <p>
      As these examples show, a <em>cast</em>
      is a type conversion operator.  Java allows a wide variety of both 
      explicit and implicit type conversions.
      Certain conversions
      (for example, <term>promotions</term>, in which, say, a <c>float</c> is
      promoted to a <c>double</c>)
      take place automatically when methods are invoked,
      when assignment statements are executed,
      when expressions are evaluated, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type conversion in Java is governed by several rules and exceptions.
      In some cases Java allows the programmer to make implicit cast conversions.
      For example,
      in the following assignment a <c>char</c> is converted 
      to an <c>int</c> even though no explicit cast operator is used:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      char ch;
      int k;
      k = ch; // convert a char into an int
    </input></program>
    <p>
      Java permits this conversion because no information will be lost.
      A  character <c>char</c> is represented in 16 bits whereas an 
      <c>int</c> is represented in 32 bits.
      This is like trying to put a small object into a large box.
      Space will be left over,
      but the object will fit inside without being damaged.
      Similarly, storing a 16-bit <c>char</c> in a 32-bit <c>int</c> will leave the extra 16 bits unused.
      This <term>widening primitive conversion</term>
      changes one primitive type (<c>char</c>) into a wider 
      one (<c>int</c>), where a type's
      <em> width</em> is the number of bits used in its representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand,
      trying to assign an <c>int</c> value to a <c>char</c> variable leads to a syntax error:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      char ch;
      int k;
      ch = k;    // Syntax error: can't assign int to char
    </input></program>
    <p>
      Trying to assign a 32-bit <c>int</c> to 16-bit <c>char</c> is like 
      trying to cram a big object into an undersized box.
      The object won't fit unless we shrink it in some way.
      Java will allow us to assign an <c>int</c> value to a <c>char</c> variable,
      but only if we perform an explicit cast on it:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      ch = (char)k; // Explicit cast of int k into char ch
    </input></program>
    <p>
      The <c>(char)</c> cast operation performs a careful
      <q>shrinking</q>
      of the <c>int</c> by lopping off the last 16 bits of the <c>int</c>. 
      This can be done without loss of information provided that
      <em>k</em>'s value is in the range 0 to 65535<mdash/>that is,
      in the range of values that fit into  a <c>char</c> variable.
      This <term>narrowing primitive conversion</term>
      changes a wider type (32-bit <c>int</c>) to a narrower type (16- bit
      <c>char</c>).
      Because of the potential here for information loss,
      it is up to the programmer to determine that the cast can be performed safely.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Type Conversion</title>
      <p>
        Java permits <term>implicit</term> type conversions
        from a narrower type to a wider type. A <term>cast</term> operator 
        must be used when converting a wider type into a narrower type.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      The cast operator can be used with any primitive type.
      It applies to the variable or expression that immediately follows it.
      Thus, parentheses must be used to cast the expression <em>m + n</em>
      into a <c>char</c>:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
     char ch = (char)(m + n);
    </input></program>
    <p>
      The following statement would cause a syntax error because the cast 
      operator would only be applied to <c>m</c>:
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
      char ch = (char)m + n; // Error: right side is an int
    </input></program>
    <p>
      In the expression on the right-hand side,
      the character produced by <c>(char)m</c> will be promoted to an 
      <c>int</c> because it is part of an integer operation whose 
      result will still be an <c>int</c>. Therefore,
      it cannot be assigned to a <c>char</c> without an explicit cast.

    <title>Lexical Ordering</title>
    <p>
      The order in which the characters are arranged,
      their <term>lexical order</term>,
      is an important feature of the character set.
      It especially comes into play for such tasks as arranging strings in alphabetical order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the actual integer values assigned to the individual 
      characters by ASCII and UNICODE encoding seem somewhat arbitrary,
      the characters are, in fact, arranged in a particular order.
      For example,
      note that various sequences of digits, <c>'0' ... '9'</c>, and 
      letters, <c>'a' ... 'z'</c> and <c>'A' ... 'Z'</c>, are 
      represented by sequences of integers (<xref ref="fig-ASCII">Figure</xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes it possible to represent the lexical order of the characters in terms 
      of the <em>less than</em>
      relationship among integers.
      The fact that <sq>a</sq> comes before <sq>f</sq> in alphabetical order 
      is represented by the fact that 97
      (the integer code for <sq>a</sq>)
      is less than 102
      (the integer code for <sq>f</sq>).
      Similarly, the digit <sq>5</sq> comes before the digit <sq>9</sq> 
      in an alphabetical sequence because 53
      (the integer code for <sq>5</sq>)
      is less than 57
      (the integer code for <sq>9</sq>).
    </p>
    <p>
      This ordering relationship extends throughout the character set.
      Thus, it is also the case that <sq>A</sq> comes before <sq>a</sq> 
      in the lexical ordering because 65
      (the integer code for <sq>A</sq>)
      is less than 97
      (the integer code for <sq>a</sq>).
      Similarly, the character <sq>[</sq> comes before <sq><c>}</c></sq> 
      because its integer code (91) is less than 125,
      the integer code for <sq><c>}</c></sq>.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Relational Operators</title>
    <p>
      Given the lexical ordering of the <c>char</c> type,
      the following relational operators can be defined:
      <m>\lt</m>, <m>></m>,
      <m>\lt</m>=, <m>></m>=, ==, !=. Given any two characters,
      <em>ch1</em> and <em>ch2</em>,
      the expression <em>ch1 <m>\lt</m> ch2</em>
      is true if and only if the integer value of <em>ch1</em>
      is less than the integer value of <em>ch2</em>.
      In this case we say that <em>ch1</em><em>precedes</em><em>ch2</em> in lexical order.
      Similarly, the expression <em>ch1 <m>></m> ch2</em>
      is true if and only if the integer value of <em>ch1</em>
      is greater than the integer value of <em>ch2</em>.
      In this case we say that <em>ch1</em><em>follows</em><em>ch2</em>.
      And so on for the other relational operators.
      This means that we can perform comparison operations on any 
      two character operands (<xref ref="tab-relops">Table</xref>).
