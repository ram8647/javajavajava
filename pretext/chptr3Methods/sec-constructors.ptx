  <title>Constructors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous section,
      we looked at several examples of mutator methods that change the values of private instance variables of an object.
      It is possible to define mutator methods to set the initial values of instance variables after an object is created,
      but initial values can also be set by <term>constructors</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
     A <term>constructor
          <idx><h>constructor</h></idx>
     </term>  is used to create an  instance
      (or object)
      of a class and to assign initial values to instance variables.
      A constructor declaration looks just like a method definition except:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol><li>it must have the same name as the class,</li>
        <li>and it does not have a return type.</li></ol>
      </p>
      <p>
      Unlike the class level variables and methods of a class,
      constructors are not considered members of the class.
      Therefore, they are not inherited by a class's subclasses.
      Constructors usually are <c>public</c>.  
      Here is a simple constructor for our <c>OneRowNim</c> class. Notice there is no return type void in between the public and the classname. 
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public OneRowNim()
{   nSticks = 7;
    player = 1;
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      This constructor merely sets the initial values of the instance  variables, <c>nSticks</c> and <c>player</c>. In our current version of
<c>OneRowNim</c> these variables are given initial values by using initializer statements when they are first declared:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
 private int nSticks = 7;
 private int player = 1;
 </input></program>
    <p>
      So we now have two ways to initialize a class's instance  variables.
      In the <c>OneRowNim</c> class it doesn't really matter which way we do it.
      However, the constructor provides more flexibility because it allows the state of the object to be initialized at runtime.
      Of course, it would be somewhat redundant
      (though permissible)
      to initialize the same variable twice,
      once when it is declared and again in the constructor,
      so we should choose one or the other way to do this.
      For now, let's stick with initializing the instance variables when they are declared.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Constructors</title>
      <p>
        Constructors provide a flexible way to initialize an object's instance variables when the object is created.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      A constructor cannot return a value and, therefore,
      its  declaration cannot include a return type.
      Because they cannot return values,
      constructors cannot be invoked by a regular method invocation.
      Instead, constructors are invoked as part of an
      <em>instance creation expression</em>
      when instance objects are created.
      An instance creation expression involves the keyword <c>new</c> followed by the constructor invocation:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim game // Declare
    = new OneRowNim(); // and instantiate game1
OneRowNim game2 // Declare
    = new OneRowNim(); // and instantiate game2
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Note here that we have combined variable declaration and instantiation into a single statement,
      whereas in some previous examples we used separate declaration and instantiation statements.
      Either way is acceptable.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Constructors</title>
      <p>
        Constructors cannot return a value.
        Therefore, no return type should be declared when the constructor is defined.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: When to Use Return</title>
      <p>
        All method definitions except constructors must declare a return type.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Constructors should be used to perform the necessary initialization operations during object creation.
      In the case of a <c>OneRowNim</c> object,
      what initializations could be performed?  One initialization that would seem appropriate is to initialize the initial number of sticks to a number specified.
      In order to do this,
      we would need a constructor with a single <c>int</c> parameter:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public OneRowNim(int sticks)
{   nSticks = sticks;
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Now that we have this constructor we can use it when we create instances of <c>OneRowNim</c>:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim game1 = new OneRowNim(21);
OneRowNim game2 = new OneRowNim(13);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The effect of these statements is the same as if we had used the <c>setSticks()</c> method that was discussed briefly in the last section.
      The difference is that we can now set the number of sticks when we create the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should we keep the preceding constructor,
      or keep the <c>setSticks()</c> method or keep both in our class definition?
      The constructor can only be invoked as part of a <c>new</c> statement when the object is created, but the <c>setSticks()</c> method could be called anytime we want.
      In many cases,
      having redundant methods for doing the same task in different ways would be an asset,
      because it allows for more flexibility in how the class could be used.
      However, for a game like One Row Nim,
      a major concern is that the two instance variables get changed only in a manner consistent with the rules for One Row Nim.
      The best way to guarantee this is to have <c>takeSticks()</c> as the only method that changes the instance variables <c>nSticks</c> and
<c>player</c>. The only time that it should be possible to set the number of sticks for a game is when a constructor is used to create a new instance of <c>OneRowNim</c>.

    <title>Default Constructors</title>
    <p>
      Java automatically provides a
      <em>default constructor</em>
      when a class does not contain a constructor.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Default Constructor</title>
      <p>
        If a class contains no constructor declarations, Java will automatically supply a default constructor.
            <idx><h>constructor default</h></idx>
        The default constructor takes no parameters.
        If the class is <c>public</c>, the default constructor will also be <c>public</c> and,
        hence, accessible to other objects.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      The default constructor's role is simply to create an instance
      (an object)
      of that class.
      It takes no parameters.
      In terms of what it does,
      the default constructor for <c>OneRowNim</c> would be equivalent to a <c>public</c> constructor method with an empty body:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public OneRowNim() { }
 </input></program>
    <p>
      This explains why the following statement was valid when a class definition of <c>OneRowNim</c> contained no explicit definition of a constructor:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim game = new OneRowNim();
 </input></program>
  </subsection>
 
  <subsection>
    <title>Constructor Overloading and Method Signatures</title>
    <p>
      It is often quite useful to have more than one constructor for  a given class.
      For example,
      consider the following two <c>OneRowNim</c> constructors:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public OneRowNim() {} // Constructor #1
public OneRowNim(int sticks)   // Constructor #2
{   nSticks = sticks;
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The first is an explicit representation of the default constructor.
      The second is the constructor we defined earlier to initialize the number of sticks in a <c>OneRowNim</c> object.
      Having multiple constructors lends flexibility to the design of a class.
      In this case,
      the first constructor merely accepts <c>OneRowNim</c>'s default initial state.
      The second enables the user to initialize the number of sticks to something other than the default value.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Java, as in some other programming languages,
      when two different  methods have the same name,
      it is known as <term>method overloading</term>.
      In this case, <c>OneRowNim</c> is used as the name for two distinct constructor methods.
      What distinguishes one constructor from another is its <term>signature</term>,
      which consists of its name together with the number and types of formal parameters it takes.
      Thus, our <c>OneRowNim</c> constructors have the following distinct signatures:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim()
OneRowNim(int)
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Both have the same name, but the first takes no parameters,
      whereas the second takes a single <c>int</c> parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same point applies  to methods in general.
      Two methods can have the same name as long as they have distinct <term>method signatures</term>.
      A class may not contain two methods with the same signature,
      but it may contain several methods with the same name,
      provided each has a distinct signature.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Method Signature</title>
      <p>
        A <term>method signature</term> consists of the method's name,
        plus the number, types, and order of its formal parameters.
        A class may not contain two methods with the same signature.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      There is no limit to the amount of <term>overloading</term> that can be done in designing constructors and methods.
      The only restriction is that each method have a distinct signature.
      For example,
      suppose in addition to the two constructors we have already defined,
      we want a constructor that would let us set both the number of sticks and the player who starts first.
      The following constructor will do what we want:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public OneRowNim(int sticks, int starter)
{   nSticks = sticks; // Set the number of sticks
    player = starter; // Set who starts
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      When calling this constructor,
      we would have to take care to pass the number of sticks as the value of the first argument and either 1 or 2 as the value of the second argument:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim game3 = new OneRowNim(14, 2);
OneRowNim game4 = new OneRowNim(31, 1);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      If we mistakenly reversed 14 and 2 in the first of these statements,
      we would end up with a <c>OneRowNim</c> game that starts with 2 sticks and has player 14 as the player with the first move.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now defined three constructor methods for the <c>OneRowNim</c> class.
      Each constructor has the name <c>OneRowNim</c>, but each has a distinct signature:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim()
OneRowNim(int)
OneRowNim(int, int)
 </input></program>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Constructor Invocation</title>
    <p>
      A constructor method is invoked only as part of a <c>new</c> expression when an instance object is first created.
      Each of  these is a valid invocation of a <c>OneRowNim</c> constructor:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
// Default constructor
OneRowNim game1 = new OneRowNim();
                  // Sets number of sticks
OneRowNim game2 = new OneRowNim(21);
                  // Sets both instance variables
OneRowNim game3 = new OneRowNim(19, 2);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The following constructor invocations are invalid because there are no matching constructor definitions:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
// No matching constructors
OneRowNim game4 = new OneRowNim("21");
OneRowNim game5 = new OneRowNim(12, 2, 5);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      In the first case,
      there is no constructor method that takes a <c>String</c> parameter,
      so there's no matching constructor.
      In the second case,
      there is no constructor that takes three <c>int</c> arguments.
      In both cases,
      the Java compiler would complain that there is no constructor method that matches the invocation.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Method Call</title>
      <p>
        The signature of the method call<mdash/>its name and the number, types,
        and order of its arguments<mdash/>must exactly match the signature of the method definition.
      </p>
    </principle>
