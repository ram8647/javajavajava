  <title>Passing Information to an Object</title>

   <subsection xml:id="accessors-mutators"><title>Accessor and Mutator Methods</title>
    <p>
      In object-oriented programming, class definitions usually provide <c>public</c> methods to
      <em>set</em> and <em>get</em>
      the values of its <c>private</c> instance variables.
      Methods that set or modify an object's instance variables are called
      <term>mutator methods</term>.
      Methods that get or retrieve the value of an instance variable are called
      <term>accessor methods</term>.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Accessor and Mutator
      Methods</title>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>An <term>accessor method</term>
            <idx><h>accessor method</h></idx>
        is a public method used to <term>get</term>
        the value of an object's instance variable.
        Such methods are often named <term>getVarName()</term>
        where <term>VarName</term>
        is the name of the variable that's being accessed.</li>
      <li>
        A <term>mutator method</term>
            <idx><h>mutator method</h></idx>
        is a public method used to modify the value of one or more instance variables.
        The special type of mutator method that <term>sets</term>
        or assigns a variable a specified value is often called
        <term>setVarName()</term>.</li></ul>

    <p>
      It is up to the designer of the class to determine which private variables require accessor and mutator methods.
      If you were designing a <c>BankAccount</c> class,
      you might want a public <c>getAccountNumber()</c> method,
      so that clients could retrieve information about their bank accounts,
      but you would probably not want a public
<c>getAccountPassword()</c> method or a public <c>setAccountBalance()</c> method.
    </p>
    </subsection>
      <subsection><title>Defining and Invoking a Method</title>
    <p>  
      There are two steps to using a method. First, you must define the method, writing a method definition, such as
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
public void printStr(String s)
{   System.out.println(s);
}
</input></program>
    <p>
      This definition defines a method that takes a single <c>String</c> parameter, <c>s</c>, and simply prints the value of its parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
      Once a method has been defined, you can <term>invoke</term> or <term>call</term> the method by writing a method call statement, such as
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
  SimpleClass object = new SimpleClass();
  object.printStr("HelloWorld");
</input></program>
    <p>
      This statement calls an object's <c>printStr()</c> method and passes it the string
      <q>HelloWorld</q>.
    </p>
    
     <activity label="printStr">
      <statement><p>Try this out in the active code below. Try changing the string in the main method and run it again.</p>
      </statement>
    <program language="java" interactive='activecode'><input>
    public class SimpleClass
    {
      public void printStr(String s)
      {   System.out.println(s);
      }
      public static void main(String[] args) 
      {
        SimpleClass object = new SimpleClass();
        object.printStr("Hello World!");
      }
    }
    </input> </program>
    </activity>

</subsection>
    <subsection><title>Parameters</title>
    <p>
      Let's turn back to our Nim game. In the <c>OneRowNim</c> class, we defined three mutator methods named <c>takeOne()</c>,
<c>takeTwo()</c>, and <c>takeThree</c> in the previous chapter.
      All three of these method change the values of the instance variables <c>nSticks</c> and <c>player</c> and  
     have very similar code.
      The definition of the <c>takeOne()</c> is:
    </p>
<program language="java">
<input>
public void takeOne()
{   nSticks = nSticks - 1;
    player = 3 - player;
}
</input>
</program>
    <p>
      The only difference in the code of the other two methods is that they subtract 2 and 3 from <c>nSticks</c> instead of 1.
      Instead of having three,
      virtually identical methods, it would be a more efficient design to define a single method where the number 
      to be subtracted from <c>nSticks</c> would be supplied as an argument when the method is called.
      In order to be able to handle such an argument,
      we must design a new method that uses a
      <em>parameter</em> to handle the argument.
    </p>
    
     
    <principle>
      <title>Formal Parameter</title>
      <p>
        A <term>formal parameter</term> or more simply, <term>parameter</term>,
            <idx><h>formal parameter</h></idx>
        is a variable that serves as a storage location for information that is passed to a method.
        To specify a formal parameter,
        you must provide a type identifier followed by variable identifier,
        and you must place this declaration inside the parentheses that follow the method's name.
      </p>
    </principle>
    
    
    <p>
      Consider the following definition for a <c>takeSticks()</c> method:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
public void takeSticks(int num)
{    nSticks = nSticks - num;
     player = 3 - player;
}
</input></program>


    <p>
      In the following figure, you can see how a call to takeSticks(2) saves the value 2 in the parameter variable num which is used in the method.
      Executing the body of <c>takeSticks()</c> when the parameter <c>num</c> stores the value 1 accomplishes precisely the same task as executing <c>takeOne()</c>. If, instead,
      a value of 2 or 3 is stored in <c>num</c>, then calling the method acts like <c>takeTwo()</c> or <c>takeThree()</c> respectively.
      Thus, using parameters enables us to design methods that are more general in what they do,
      which is an important principle of good program design.

{   private int nSticks = 7;         // Start with 7 sticks
    private int player = 1;          // Player 1 plays first

    /** 
     * takeSticks() will remove num sticks
     * @param num -- the number of sticks to remove.
     */
    public void takeSticks(int num)
    {   nSticks = nSticks - num;
        player = 3 - player;
    }  // takeSticks()

    public void report()
    {   System.out.println("Number of sticks left: " + nSticks);
        System.out.println("Next turn by player " + player);
    } // report()

    public static void main (String argv[])
    { 
      OneRowNim game = new OneRowNim(); // Declare a OneRowNim instance called game
      game.report();               // Report state of game
      game.takeSticks(1);     // remove 1 stick
      game.report();
      game.takeSticks(2);     // remove 2 sticks
      game.report();
      // Add code here to take 3 sticks and report

    } // end of main
} // OneRowNim class
</input></program>
</activity>

   
    <p>
      Another example of a mutator method is one in which define a <term>set method</term>
      to allow the starting number of sticks to be set for an instance of <c>OneRowNim</c>. For this,
      we could define:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
public void setSticks(int sticks)
{    
  nSticks = sticks;
} // setSticks()
</input></program>
    <p>
      As we will see in <xref ref="constructors">Section</xref>,
      we can also define a constructor method that can be used,
      when the game is created,
      to set the initial value of <c>nSticks</c>. 
      It is often desirable to have more than one method that sets the values of an objects' instance variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a method uses more than one parameter,
      use a comma to separate the individual parameter declarations in the method header.
      For example,
      if we wanted a method for <c>OneRowNim</c> that specified both the number of sticks for the start of a game and which player takes a turn first,
      it could be defined:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
public void setGame(int sticks, int starter)
{   nSticks = sticks;
    player = starter; 
} // setGame()
</input></program>

</subsection>
      <subsection><title>Local vs. Class Scope</title>
  
    <p>
      The bodies of the mutator methods in the previous section make use of both instance variables like <c>nSticks</c> and 
    parameter variables like <c>num</c>.
      It is important to note that there is a difference in where these two types of variables can be used.
      The <term>scope</term>
          <idx><h>scope</h></idx>
      of a variable or method refers to where it can be used in a program.
    </p>
    <p>
      A parameter's scope
          <idx><h>parameter scope</h></idx>
      is limited to the body of the method in which it is declared.
      Variables that are declared in the body of a method have scope which extends from the point where they are declared to the end of the block of code in which they are declared.
      Parameters are local variables which are declared in the parameter list of a method's header and which have initial values specified by the arguments in a method call.
      The scope of a parameter is the same as the scope of a variable declared at the very beginning of the body of a method.  Once the flow of execution leaves a method,
      its parameters and other local variables cease to exist.
      The scope of local variables is referred to as <term>local scope</term>.
          <idx><h>local scope</h></idx>
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Scope</title>
      <p>
        Local variables, that is,
        parameters and variables declared in the body of a method,
        have <term>local scope</term>
            <idx><h>local scope</h></idx>
        which extends from the point at which they are defined to the end of the block of code in which they are defined.
        In particular,
        the scope of a parameter is the entire body of the method in which it is declared.
      </p>
    </principle>
    
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Scope Error</title>
      <p>
        It would be a syntax error to refer to a method's parameters or other local variables from outside the method.
      </p>
    </principle>
    
    <p>
      By contrast, instance variables, class variables,
      and all methods have scope that extends throughout the entire class,
      that is, <term>class scope</term>.
      They can be used in the body of any method and in the expressions that assign initial values to class level variables.
      </p>

<figure xml:id="fig-scope">
      <caption>Argument to Parameter Mapping</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="chptr03/scope.png"/>
    </figure>      
      
      <p>
      There are two restrictions to remember.
      First, instance variables and instance methods cannot be used in the body of a class <c>static</c> method,
      unless an instance of the class is created there and then the dot notation of qualified names must be used to  refer to the variable or method.
      This is because class methods are called without reference to a particular instance of the class.
      The
<c>main()</c> method of the <c>OneRowNim</c> class that we defined in the previous chapter is an example of such a class method.
      In that case,
      to test the instance methods of <c>OneRowNim</c> we first created an instance of <c>OneRowNim</c> and used it to call its instance methods:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim game = new OneRowNim(); // Create instance
game.report();   // Call an instance method
</input></program>
    <p>
      The second restriction involved in class scope is that one class level variable can be used in the expression that initializes a second class level variable only if the first is declared before the second.
      There is no similar restriction on methods.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Scope</title>
      <p>
        Class level variables, that is,
        instance variables and class variables have <term>class scope</term>,
            <idx><h>class scope</h></idx>
        which extends throughout the class.
        Methods also have class scope.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Except for the restrictions noted above,
      methods and class level variables can be referred to within the same class by their simple names,
      with just the method
      (or variable)
      name itself,  rather than by their qualified names,
      with the dot operator.
      Thus, in
<c>OneRowNim</c>, we can refer to <c>nSticks</c> and <c>report()</c> in the bodies of other instance methods.
      In a class method,
      such as
<c>main()</c>, we would have to create an instance of <c>OneRowNim</c> with a name like <c>game</c> and refer to <c>game.report()</c>.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Qualified Names</title>
      <p>
        Within the same class,
        references to class methods or class variables can be made by using just their names.
        Within the bodies of instance methods,
        references to instance variables and references to other instance methods can also be made by using just their names.
        However, within the bodies of class methods, qualified
            <idx><h>qualified name</h></idx>
        names, or dot notation,
        must be used to refer to instance methods or instance variables just like how they are referred to in other classes.
      </p>
    </principle>
    
  </subsection>

    <title>Arguments and Parameters</title>
    <p>
      The new class definition for <c>OneRowNim</c> is given in <xref ref="fig-ornclass2">Listing</xref>.
    
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-ornclass2">
      <caption>The <c>OneRowNim</c> class definition with <c>takeSticks()</c> method.</caption>
 
<program language="java"><input>
public class OneRowNim
{ private int nSticks = 7; // Start with 7 sticks
  private int player = 1;  //Player 1 plays first
  public void takeSticks(int num)
  { nSticks = nSticks - num;
    player = 3 - player;
  }  // takeSticks()
  public void report()
  { System.out.println("Number of sticks left: " + nSticks);
    System.out.println("Next turn by player " + player);
  }   // report()} //OneRowNim1 class
</input></program>
</listing>
    <p>
      Note that now that we have a single method, <c>takeSticks()</c>, that can be used to take away a variable number of sticks,
      we have removed the three methods we wrote in the previous chapter, <c>takeOne()</c>, <c>takeTwo()</c>, and <c>takeThree()</c>, from <c>OneRowNim</c>. Using a single method,
      with a parameter, is clearly a better design.
      To see this,
      just imagine what we would have to do if we didn't use a parameter and we wanted to be able to take away four sticks,
      or five, or more.
      If we didn't have parameters,
      we'd have to write a separate method for each case,
      which is clearly a bad idea.
      Using parameters in this way leads to a more general useful method and thus is an example of the generality principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's consider how we would create a <c>OneRowNim</c> instance and use the new method in the <c>main()</c> method or in a different class.
      If we want to have an instance of <c>OneRowNim</c> object to remove 3 sticks on the first move by using the <c>takeSticks()</c> method,
      we need to pass the <c>int</c> value 3 to the method.
      In order to effect this action,
      we would use the following statements:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
OneRowNim game = new OneRowNim();
game.takeSticks(3);
</input></program>
    <p>
      Because the definition of <c>takeSticks()</c> includes a single <c>int</c> parameter,
      we must supply a single <c>int</c> value
      (such as 3),
      when we invoke it.
      When the method is invoked,
      its formal parameter (<c>num</c>) will be set to the value we supply (3).
      The value we supply does not have to be a literal <c>int</c> value.
      We can supply any expression or variable that evaluates to an <c>int</c> value.
      For example:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
int val = 7 - 5;
game.takeSticks(val);
</input></program>
    <p>
      In this case,
      the value being passed to <c>takeSticks()</c> is 2, the value that <c>val</c> has at the time the method call is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be an error to try to pass a value that was not a
<c>int</c> to <c>takeSticks()</c>. For example,
      each of the following invocations of <c>takeSticks()</c> results in a syntax error:
    </p>
<program language="java"><input>
game.takeSticks();     // no argument is supplied
game.takeSticks("3");  // "3" is a String, not an int
game.takeSticks(int);  // int is not an int value
</input></program>
    <p>
      The value that is passed to a method when it is invoked is called  an argument.
      Even though the terms argument and parameter
          <idx><h>parameter</h></idx>
      are sometimes used interchangeably,
      it will be useful to observe a distinction.
      We will use the term <em>parameter</em>
      to refer to the formal parameter<mdash/>the variable used to pass data to a method<mdash/>that occurs in the method definition.
      We use the term <em>argument</em>
      to refer to the actual value that is supplied when the method is invoked.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Type Error</title>
      <p>
        It would be a syntax error to use an argument whose type doesn't match the type of its corresponding parameter.
      </p>
    </principle>
  
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Passing an <c>int</c> value to a <c>OneRowNim</c> method</title>
    <p>
      To get a clearer picture of the interaction that takes place when we invoke <c>takeSticks()</c> and pass it an <c>int</c> value,
      let's write a
<c>main()</c> method to test our new version of <c>OneRowNim</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first version of <c>main()</c> is shown in <xref ref="fig-testorn1">Listing</xref>.
      We will use it to trace how the parameter  of <c>takeSticks()</c> interacts with the instance variables <c>nSticks</c> and <c>player</c>. The statements in the <c>main()</c> program simply create an instance of <c>OneRowNim</c> that is referenced by
      <c>game</c> and invoke the <c>setSticks()</c> method with an argument of 3.
         
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-testorn1">
      <caption>A <c>main()</c> method to test the <c>takeSticks()</c> method.</caption>
<program language="java"><input>
public static void main (String argv[])
{  OneRowNim game;        // Declare a OneRowNim object
   game = new OneRowNim(); // Instantiate the references
   game.takeSticks(3);     // remove 3 sticks
} // main()
</input></program>
</listing>
 
    <p>
      To get a clearer understanding of how a parameter works,
      it will be instructive to trace through the code in <c>main()</c>. 
      The <xref ref="fig-parameps">Figure</xref>below displays how the states of the instance variables of <c>game</c> and the parameter of <c>takeSticks()</c> interact.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-parameps">

      <image width="73%" source="chptr03/param.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Executing the first two statements of <c>main()</c> creates the instance <c>game</c> of <c>OneRowNim</c>. Figure<nbsp/>3.3(a) shows the initial state of <c>game</c>. When the <c>takeSticks(3)</c> method call is made,
      a parameter
      (which is a local variable)
      named
<c>num</c> is created and the value 3 is stored in it.
      The state of the instance variables and the parameter are shown in (b).
      Then the body of <c>takeSticks()</c> is executed.
      The new state of <c>game</c> is shown in (c).
      After the flow of control leaves the body of <c>takeSticks()</c> and returns to <c>main()</c>, the memory location which stored the value of the parameter <c>num</c> is released for other uses.
      The state of <c>game</c> at this point is shown in (d).
      Notice that the value of <c>nSticks</c> has been reduced to 4.

    <title>Passing keyboard input to <c>takeSticks()</c></title>
    <p>
      To complete this section,
      let's modify our <c>main()</c> method in <xref ref="fig-testorn1">Listing</xref>
      so that it prompts the user to input an integer from the keyboard and then uses a Scanner object,
      introduced in the previous chapter, to read the integer.
      That integer will then be used as the argument in a call to <c>takeSticks()</c>. 
      These modifications have been incorporated into the revised version of the
<c>main()</c> method shown in <xref ref="fig-testorn2">Figure</xref>.
     
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-testorn2">
      <caption>A <c>main()</c> method with keyboard input for <c>OneRowNim</c>.</caption>
<program language="java"><input>
import java.util.Scanner;
public static void main (String argv[])
{ Scanner sc;             // Declare a Scanner variable
  sc = Scanner.create(System.in); // Instantiate it
  OneRowNim game;         // Declare a OneRowNim variable
  game = new OneRowNim(); // Instantiate it
  game.report();          // Report state of game
  System.out.println("Input 1, 2, or 3 and hit enter:");
  int num = sc.nextInt(); // Read an int from keyboard
  game.takeSticks(num);   // Use the value read
  game.report();          // Report state of game
} // main()
</input></program>
</listing>
    <p>
      If we now run this program, the following output will be generated in the console window before waiting for keyboard input:
    </p>
 <pre>
Number of sticks left: 7
Next turn by player 1
Input 1, 2, or 3 and hit enter:
</pre>
    <p>
      If the user then inputs a 2 from the keyboard,
      that input will be read and the <c>takeSticks()</c> method will remove 2 sticks.
      The output in the console window will now look like:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
Number of sticks left: 7
Next turn by player 1
Input 1, 2, or 3 and hit enter:2
Number of sticks left: 5
Next turn by player 2
