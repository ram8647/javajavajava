  <title>Testing an Improved OneRowNim</title>
  
<subsection><title>Using If/Else Structures</title>
  <p>
    Let's use the control structures that we have discussed to improve the definition of the <c>takeSticks()</c> method of <c>OneRowNim</c>. We noted earlier that our current definition allows <m>4</m> or more sticks to be removed from <c>nSticks</c> even though the rules of One Row Nim indicate that a player must take one,
    two, or three sticks on a turn.
    We can use <c>if-else</c> statements to make certain that no more than <m>3</m> sticks get removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    What should happen if the method <c>takeSticks()</c> is called with an argument that does not represent a legal number of sticks to remove?
    In this case,
    it would probably make sense to remove no sticks at all and to keep the value of <c>player</c> the same so that the player whose turn it is does not change.
    In addition,
    it would be nice if the method could signal that an illegal move has been attempted.
    This can be accomplished if we redefine <c>takeSticks()</c> to return a <c>boolean</c> value.
    Let's have a return value of <c>true</c> represent the case that a valid number of sticks have been removed and the player to play next has been changed.
    A return of <c>false</c> will indicate that an illegal move has been attempted.
    Making these changes to the <c>takeSticks()</c> method will yield a method definition that looks like:
  </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public boolean takeSticks(int num)
{   if (num &lt; 1) {
       return false; // Error
    } else if ( num > 3) {
       return false; // Error
    } else {
       nSticks = nSticks - num;
       player = 3 - player;
       return true;
    } //else
 } //takeSticks
 </input></program>
  <p>
    Notice that the new definition of the <c>takeSticks()</c> method has a boolean return type.
    Also notice that the <c>if/else</c> multiway structure is used to handle the three cases of the parameter <c>num</c> being less than one,
    more than three, or a valid number. Try the code below to see it running.
  </p>

            game.report();
        } // main()
      } // OneRowNim class

  <p>
    Let us add one more method to the <c>OneRowNim</c> class.
    Let's define a method called <c>getWinner()</c> that will return the number of the winning player if the game is over.
    Recall that the player who takes the last stick loses,
    so after that last play,
    the player whose turn it is to play next is the winner.
    However, we should be concerned about what value to return if the game is not over when the method is called.
    A common strategy is to have a method return a special value to indicate that it is in a state in which it cannot return the value requested.
    Returning a <m>0</m> value is a good way to indicate that the game is not over so a winner cannot be identified.
    With this information,
    the <c>if/else</c> statement can be used in the definition of
<c>getWinner()</c>.
  </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public int getWinner()
{   if (nSticks &lt; 1)
        return player;
    else
        return 0;
} // getWinner()
 </input></program>
  <p>
    We now have the final version
    (for this chapter)
    of the <c>OneRowNim</c> class whose implementation is given in <xref ref="fig-ornclass">Figure</xref>.
    We have turned a very simple class into one that contains quite a few elements.
    Compared to our first version
    (in Chapter 1),
    this Chapter's version of <c>OneRowNim</c> presents an interface
    (to other objects)
    that is easy and convenient to use.
    The constructor methods with parameters provide an easy way to create a
<c>OneRowNim</c> instance with any number of sticks.
    The use of <c>private</c> instance variables and a single,
    carefully designed mutator method, <c>takeSticks()</c>, prevents other objects from tampering with the state of a <c>OneRowNim</c> object's state.
    The other methods provide a flexible way to find out the state of a <c>OneRowNim</c> object.
    The complete implementation of this <c>OneRowNim</c> is shown in <xref ref="fig-ornclass">Figure</xref>.

  <subsection><title>Using a While Loop</title>
  <p>
    Let's use a while statement to test the new methods of the class.
    A pseudocode description of how a game is played might look like:
  </p>
 <algorithm>
 <program language="java"><input>
  Choose the initial number of sticks for the game
  while the game is not over {   
      Report the state of the game
      Process the next move
  }
  Report the state of the game
  Report who the winner is
</input></program>

  Here is a version with a main method that chooses a random number of sticks each time through the loop.

    Note that the return value of the <c>takeSticks()</c> method is ignored in this test program.
    We will make use of the return value in test programs in the next chapter when 
    better user interfaces are developed for <c>OneRowNim</c>. Note,
    however, that taken together,
    the public methods for <c>OneRowNim</c> provide other objects with an 
    interface that they can use to communicate with individual <c>OneRowNim</c> objects.
  </p>
  <principle>
    <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Interfaces</title>
    <p>
      Well-designed objects provide a useful public interface and protect 
      the object's private elements from other objects.
    </p>
  </principle>
  <p>
    To reiterate a point made at the outset,
    object-oriented programming  is a process of constructing objects that will interact with each other.
    Object-oriented programs must ensure that the objects themselves are well designed in terms of their ability to carry out their designated functions.
    Good design in this sense requires careful selection of instance variables and careful design of methods to ensure that the object can carry out its assigned tasks.
    However, equal care must be taken to ensure that the interactions that take place among objects are constrained in ways that make sense for that particular program.
    This aspect of designing objects comes into play in designing the methods<mdash/>constructor,
    accessor,
    and mutator<mdash/>that make up the object's interface.
