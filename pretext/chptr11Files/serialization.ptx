  <title>Object Serialization: Reading and Writing Objects</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The examples in the previous sections showed how to perform I/O operations on simple binary data or text.
      The <c>java.io</c> package also provides methods for reading and writing objects,
      a process known as <term>object serialization</term>.
          <idx><h>object serialization</h></idx>
      Objects can be converted into a sequence of bytes, or <em>serialized</em>,
      by using the
      <c>ObjectOutputStream</c> class,
      and they can be <em>deserialized</em>,
      or converted from bytes into a structured object,
      by using the <c>ObjectInputStream</c> class (<xref ref="fig-objiouml"></xref>).
      Despite the complexity of the serialization/deserialization processes,
      the methods in these classes make the task just as easy as reading and writing primitive data.

  <title>The <c>Serializable</c> Interface</title>
    <p>
      To illustrate object serialization,
      let's begin by defining a
      <c>Student</c> class (<xref ref="fig-student">Listing</xref>).
      In order to serialize an object,
      it must be a member of a class that implements the
      <c>Serializable</c> interface.
      The <c>Serializable</c> interface is a
      <term>marker interface</term>,
      an interface that doesn't define any methods or constants but just serves to designate 
      whether an object can be serialized or not.
    </p>

 <program language="java"><input>
import java.io.*;
public class Student implements Serializable {
  private String name;
  private int year;
  private double gpa;
  public Student() {}
  public Student (String nameIn, int yr, double gpaIn) {
    name = nameIn;
    year = yr;
    gpa = gpaIn;
  }

  public void writeToFile(FileOutputStream outStream)
                                     throws IOException{
    ObjectOutputStream ooStream = new ObjectOutputStream(outStream);
    ooStream.writeObject(this);
    ooStream.flush();
  } // writeToFile()
  
  public void readFromFile(FileInputStream inStream)
           throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    ObjectInputStream oiStream = new ObjectInputStream(inStream);
    Student s = (Student)oiStream.readObject();
    this.name = s.name;
    this.year = s.year;
    this.gpa = s.gpa;
  } // readFromFile()
  
  public String toString() {
    return name + "\t" + year + "\t" + gpa;
  }
} // Student
 </input></program>
    </listing>
    <p>
      The <c>Student</c> class contains its own I/O methods,
      <c>readFromFile()</c> and <c>writeToFile()</c>. This is an appropriate object-oriented design.
      The <c>Student</c> class encapsulates all the relevant information needed to read and write its data.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: I/O Design</title>
      <p>
        If an object is going to be input and output to and from files,
        it should define its own I/O methods.
        An object contains all the relevant information needed to perform I/O correctly.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Note the definition of the <c>writeToFile()</c> method,
      which performs the output task.
      This method's <c>FileOutputStream</c> parameter is used to 
      create an <c>ObjectOutputStream</c>, whose <c>writeObject()</c> method writes the object into the file.
      To output a <c>Student</c> object,
      we merely invoke the <c>writeObject()</c> method.
      This method writes out the current values of all the object's public and private fields.
      In this case,
      the method would write a <c>String</c> for the object's <c>name</c>, an <c>int</c> 
      for the object's <c>year</c>, and a <c>double</c> for the object's <c>gpa</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although our example doesn't require it,
      the <c>writeObject()</c> method can also handle fields that refer to other objects.
      For example,
      suppose our <c>Student</c> object provided a field for
      <c>courses</c> that contained a reference to an array of objects,
      each of which described a course the student has taken.
      In that case,
      the <c>writeObject()</c> method would serialize the array and all its objects
      (assuming they are serializable).
      Thus, when a complex object is serialized,
      the result would be a complex structure that contains all the data linked to that root object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Object deserialization,
      as shown in the <c>readFromFile()</c> method,  is simply the reverse of the serialization process.
      The <c>readObject()</c> method reads one serialized object from the
      <c>ObjectInputStream</c>. Its result type is <c>Object</c>, so it is necessary to cast the result into the proper type.
      In our example we use a local <c>Student</c> variable to store the object as it is input.
      We then copy each field of the local object to <c>this</c> object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the <c>readFromFile()</c> method throws both the
      <c>IOException</c> and <c>ClassNotFoundException</c>. An <c>IOException</c> will be generated 
      if the file you are attempting to read does not contain serialized objects of the correct type.
      Objects that can be input by <c>readObject()</c> are those that were output by
      <c>writeObject()</c>. Thus,
      just as in the case of binary I/O, it is best to design an object's input and output 
      routines together so that they are compatible.
      The <c>ClassNotFoundException</c> will be thrown if the
      <c>Student</c> class cannot be found.
      This is needed to determine how to deserialize the object.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: Object Serialization</title>
      <p>
        Java's serialization classes, <c>ObjectOutputStream</c> and <c>ObjectInputStream</c>, 
        should be used whenever an object needs to be input or output from a stream.
      </p>

    <title>The <c>ObjectIO</c>Class</title>
    <p>
      Given the <c>Student</c> class,
      let's now write a user interface that can read and write <c>Student</c> objects.
      We can use the same interface we used in the <c>BinaryIO</c> program.
      The only things we need to change are the <c>writeRecords()</c> and <c>readRecords()</c> methods.
      Everything else about this program will be exactly the same as in <c>BinaryIO</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-objectioclass">Listing</xref>
      provides the full implementation of the <c>ObjectIO</c> class.
      Note that the <c>writeRecords()</c> method will still write five random records to the data file.
      The difference in this case is that we will call the <c>Student.writeToFile()</c> 
      method to take care of the actual output operations.
      The revised algorithm will create a new <c>Student</c> object,
      using randomly generated data for its name, year,
      and GPA and then invoke its <c>writeToFile()</c> to output its data.
      Note how a <c>FileOutputStream</c> is created and passed to the <c>Student.\-writeToFile()</c> method.

    <p>
      The <c>readRecords()</c> method (Fig.
      <xref ref="fig-objectioclass"></xref>, Part II) will read data from a file containing serialized <c>Student</c> objects.
      To do so, it first creates a Student object and then invokes its <c>readFromFile()</c> method,
      passing it a <c>FileInputStream</c>. Note how the <c>FileInputStream</c> is created and,
      unlike in <c>BinaryIO</c>, the inner try block is exited by an IOException rather than an <c>EOFException</c>.

          <p>
            Given the following definition,
            would a binary file consisting of several <c>SomeObject</c>s be readable 
            by either the <c>BinaryIO</c> or the <c>ObjectIO</c> programs?
            Explain.

public class SomeObject {
    private String str;
    private short n1;
    private short n2;
    private long  n3;

 </input></program>
 <solution>
         <p>
          Yes, a binary file containing several <c>SomeObjects</c> would be
          <q>readable</q>
          by the <c>BinaryIO</c> program because the program will read a <c>String</c> followed by 64 bytes.
          However, <c>BinaryIO</c> would misinterpret the data,
          because it will assume that <c>n1</c> and
          <c>n2</c> together comprise a single <c>int</c>, and <c>n3</c>(64 bits) will be 
          interpreted as a <c>double</c>. A file of <c>SomeObject</c>s could not be read by 
          the <c>ObjectIO</c> program,
          because <c>SomeObject</c> does not implement the <c>Serializable</c> interface.
