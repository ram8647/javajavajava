  <title>Example: Reading and Writing Binary Files</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Although text files are extremely useful and often employed,
      they can't and shouldn't be used for every data-processing application.
      For example,
      your college's administrative data system undoubtedly uses files to store student records.
      Because your student record contains a variety of different types of data <mdash/><c>String</c>,
      <c>int</c>s, <c>double</c> <mdash/>it cannot be processed as text.
      Similarly, a company's inventory files,
      which also include data of a wide variety of types,
      cannot be processed as text.
      Files such as these must be processed as binary data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you are asked to write an application that involves the use of a company's employee records.
      Recall that a record is a structure that combines different types of data into a single entity.
      It's like an object with no methods, just instance variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      A binary file is a sequence of bytes.
      Unlike a text file,
      which is terminated by a special end-of-file marker,
      a binary file consists of nothing but data.
      A binary file doesn't have an end-of-file character because any such character would be indistinguishable from a binary datum.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: End of Binary File</title>
      <p>
        Because a binary file does not have an end-of-file character,
        it would be an error to use the same loop-entry conditions we used in the loops 
        we designed for reading text files.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Generally speaking,
      the steps involved in reading and writing binary files are the same as for text files:
    </p>
    <algorithm>
    <title>Processing binary files</title>
    <program language="java"><input>
      Connect a stream to the file.
      Read or write the data, possibly using a loop. 
      Close the stream.
    </input></program>
    </algorithm>
    <p>
      The difference between text and binary file I/O resides in the Java streams that we use.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="sec-binary-data">
    <title>Writing Binary Data</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let's begin by designing a method that will output employee data to a binary file.
        As the developer of this program,
        one thing you'll have  to do is build some sample data files.
        These can't easily be built by hand<mdash/>remember you can't use a text editor to 
        create them<mdash/>so you'll want to develop a method that can generate some random data 
        of the sort your application will have to process.
      </p>
      <principle>
        <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: I/O Design</title>
        <p>
          When designing file I/O applications,
          it is good to design the input and the output methods together.
          This is especially important for binary I/O.
        </p>
      </principle>
      <p>
        The first thing we need to know is exactly what the data look like.
        Let's assume that each record contains three individual pieces of data<mdash/>the employee's name, age,
        and pay rate.
        For example,
        the data in a file containing four records might look like this,
        once the data are interpreted:
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
Name0 24 15.06
Name1 25 5.09
Name2 40 11.45
Name3 52 9.25
 </input></program>
      <p>
        As you can see,
        these data look as if they were randomly generated,
        but they resemble the real data in the important respects: 
        They are of the right type<mdash/><c>String</c>, <c>int</c>, <c>double</c><mdash/>and have the right kind of values.
        Of course, when these data are stored in the file,
        or in the program's memory,
        they just look like one long string of 0's and 1's.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach to designing this output method will be the same as the approach we used in designing 
        methods for text I/O. That is, we start with two questions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              What stream classes should I use?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              What methods can I use?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        And we find the answers to these by searching through the <c>java.io</c> package 
        <xref ref="fig-streamhier">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="tab-streams">Table</xref>).
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-fostream">
        <caption>The <c>FileOutputStream</c> class.</caption>
        <image width="73%" source="chptr11/fostream.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Because we are performing binary output,
        we need to use some subclass of <c>OutputStream</c>. Because we're outputting to a file,
        one likely candidate is <c>FileOutputStream</c>(Fig.
        <xref ref="fig-fostream"></xref>).
        This class has the right kind of constructors,
        but it only contains <c>write()</c> methods for writing <c>int</c> and <c>byte</c> data, and 
        we need to be able to write <c>String</c>  and <c>double</c> data as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        These kinds of methods are found in <c>DataOutputStream</c>
         (<xref ref="fig-dostream">Figure</xref>),
        which contains a <c>write()</c> method for each different type of data.
        As you can see, there's one method for each primitive type.
        However, note that the <c>writeChar()</c> takes an
        <c>int</c> parameter,
        which indicates that the character is written in binary format rather than as a ASCII or Unicode character.
        Although you can't tell by just reading its method signature,
        the <c>writeChars(String)</c> method also writes its data in binary format rather than as a sequence of characters.
        This is the main difference between these <c>write()</c> methods and the ones defined in the 
        <c>Writer</c> branch of Java's I/O hierarchy.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-dostream">
      <caption>The <c>DataOutputStream</c> class.</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="chptr11/dostream.png"/>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Now that we've found the appropriate classes and methods,
        we need to create a pipeline to write data to the file and develop an output algorithm.
        To construct a stream to use in writing employee records,
        we want to join together a <c>DataOutputStream</c> and a <c>FileOutputStream</c>. The
        <c>DataOutputStream</c> gives us the output methods we need,
        and the <c>FileOutputStream</c> lets us use the file's name to create the stream:
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
DataOutputStream outStream
  = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream (fileName));
 </input></program>
      <p>
        This enables the program to write data to the <c>DataOutputStream</c>, which will pass them 
        through the <c>FileOutputStream</c> to the file itself.
        That settles the first question.
      </p>
      <p>
        To develop the output algorithm,
        we need some kind of loop that involves calls to the appropriate methods.
        In this case, because we are generating random data,
        we can use a simple for loop to generate,
        say, five records of employee data.
        We need one <c>write()</c> statement for each of the elements in the employee record: 
        The name (<c>String</c>), age (<c>int</c>), and pay rate (<c>double</c>):
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
for (int k = 0; k &lt; 5; k++) {  // Output 5 data records
 outStream.writeUTF("Name" + k);             // Name
 outStream.writeInt((int)(20 + Math.random() * 25)); //Age
 outStream.writeDouble(Math.random() * 500); // Payrate}
 </input></program>
      <p>
        Within the loop body we have one output statement for each data element in the record.
        The names of the methods reflect the type of data they write.
        Thus, we use <c>writeInt()</c> to write an <c>int</c> and <c>writeDouble()</c> to write 
        a <c>double</c>. But why do we use <c>writeUTF</c> to write the employee's name,
        a <c>String</c>?
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsubsection>
      <title>The Unicode Text Format (UTF)</title>
      <p>
        There is no <c>DataOutputStream.writeString()</c> method.
        Instead, <c>String</c>s are written using the <c>writeUTF()</c> method.
        <term>UTF</term>
            <idx><h>UTF</h></idx>
        stands for <term>Unicode Text Format</term>,
        a coding scheme for Java's Unicode character set.
        Recall that Java uses the Unicode character set instead of the ASCII set.
        As a 16-bit code, Unicode can represent 8-bit ASCII characters plus a wide 
        variety of Asian and other international characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Unicode is not a very efficient coding scheme if you aren't writing an international program.
        If your program just uses the standard ASCII characters,
        which can be stored in 1 byte,
        you would be wasting 1 byte per character if you stored them as straight Unicode characters.
        Therefore, for efficiency purposes, Java uses the UTF format.
        UTF encoding can still represent all of the Unicode characters,
        but it provides a more efficient way of representing the ASCII subset.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's now time to combine these separate elements into a single method 
        (<xref ref="fig-writerecordsmethod">Figure</xref>).
        The <c>writeRecords()</c> method takes a single <c>String</c> parameter that specifies the name of the file.
        This is a <c>void</c> method.
        It will output data to a file,
        but it will not return anything to the calling method.
        The method follows the standard output algorithm: Create an output stream,
        write the data, close the stream.
        Note also that the method includes a <c>try/catch</c> block to handle any <c>IOException</c>s that might be thrown.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-writerecordsmethod">
        <caption>A method to write a binary file consisting of five
        randomly constructed records.</caption>
 <program language="java"><input>
private void writeRecords( String fileName )  {
 try {
   DataOutputStream outStream   // Open stream
      = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fileName));
   for (int k = 0; k &lt; 5; k++) { // Output 5 data records
      String name = "Name" + k;  // of name, age, payrate
      outStream.writeUTF("Name" + k);
      outStream.writeInt((int)(20 + Math.random() * 25));
      outStream.writeDouble(5.00 + Math.random() * 10);
   } // for
   outStream.close();          // Close the stream
 } catch (IOException e) {
   display.setText("IOERROR: " + e.getMessage() + "\n");
 }
} // writeRecords()

    <title>Reading Binary Data</title>
    <p>
      The steps involved in reading data from a binary file are the same as for 
      reading data from a text file: Create an input stream and open the file,
      read the data, close the file.
      The main difference lies in the way you check for the end-of-file marker in a binary file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's design a method to read the binary data that were output by the <c>writeRecords()</c> method.
      We'll call this method <c>readRecords()</c>. It, too,
      will consist of a single <c>String</c> parameter that provides the name of the file to be read,
      and it will be a void method.
      It will just display the data on <c>System.out</c>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-fistream">
    <caption>The <c>FileInputStream</c> class.</caption>
    <image width="60%" source="chptr11/fistream.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The next questions we need to address are: What stream classes should we use,
      and what methods should we use?
      For binary input,
      we need an <c>InputStream</c> subclass 
      (<xref ref="fig-streamhier">Figure</xref> and <xref ref="tab-streams">Table</xref>).
      As you've probably come to expect,
      the <c>FileInputStream</c> class contains constructors that let us create a stream from a file name 
      (<xref ref="tab-streams">Table</xref>).
      However, it does not contain useful <c>read()</c> methods.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-datainputstream">
    <caption>The <c>DataInputStream</c> class contains methods for reading all types of data.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="chptr11/datainputstream.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Fortunately,
      the <c>DataInputStream</c> class contains the input counterparts of the 
      methods we found in <c>DataOutputStream</c> (<xref ref="fig-datainputstream">Figure</xref>).
      Therefore, our input stream for this method will be a combination of 
      <c>DataInputStream</c> and <c>FileInputStream</c>:
    </p>

 <program language="java"><input>
DataInputStream inStream
   = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Now that we have identified the classes and methods we'll use to read the data,
      the most important remaining issue is designing a read loop that will terminate correctly.
      Unlike text files,
      binary files do not contain a special end-of-file marker.
      Therefore, the read methods can't see anything in the file that tells them they're at the end of the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, when a binary read method attempts to read past the end of the file,
      an end-of-file exception <c>EOFException</c> is thrown.
      Thus, the binary loop is coded as an infinite loop that's exited when the <c>EOFException</c> is 
      raised: 
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
try {
  while (true) {                        // Infinite loop
    String name = inStream.readUTF();   // Read a record
    int age = inStream.readInt();
    double pay = inStream.readDouble();
    display.append(name + " " + age + " " + pay + "\n");
  } // while
} catch (EOFException e) {} // Until EOF exception
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The read loop is embedded within a <c>try/catch</c> statement.
      Note that the <c>catch</c> clause for the <c>EOFException</c> does nothing.
      Recall that when an exception is thrown in a <c>try</c> block,
      the block is exited for good,
      which is precisely the action we want to take.
      That's why we needn't do anything when we catch the <c>EOFException</c>. 
      We have to catch the exception or else Java will catch it and terminate the program.
      This is an  example of an expected exception.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: <c>EOFException</c></title>
      <p>
        An attempt to read past the end of a binary file will cause an <c>EOFException</c> to be thrown.
        Catching this exception is the standard way of terminating a binary input loop.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Note also the <c>read()</c> statements within the loop are mirror opposites 
      of the <c>write()</c> statements in the method that created the data.
      This will generally be true for binary I/O routines: 
      The statements that read data from a file should
      <q>match</q> those that wrote the data in the first place.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Matching Input to Output</title>
      <p>
        The statements used to read binary data should match those that wrote the data.
        If a <c>writeX()</c> method were used to write the data,
        a <c>readX()</c> should be used to read<nbsp/>it.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      To complete the method,
      the only remaining task is to <c>close()</c> the stream after the data are read.
      The complete definition is shown in <xref ref="fig-readrecordsmethod">Listing</xref>.
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-readrecordsmethod">

    <p>
      It's important that a <c>close()</c> statement be placed after the
      <c>catch EOFException</c> clause.
      If it were placed in the <c>try</c> block,
      it would never get executed.
      Note also that the entire method is embedded in an outer <c>try</c> block that catches the
      <c>IOException</c>, thrown by the various <c>read()</c> methods,
      and the
      <c>FileNotFoundException</c>, thrown by the <c>FileInputStream()</c> constructor.
      These make the method a bit longer,
      but conceptually they belong in this method.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: The <c>finally</c>Block</title>
      <p>
        In coding a binary read loop,
        the try block is exited as soon as the <c>EOFException</c> is raised.
        Therefore, the <c>close()</c> statement must be placed in the <c>finally</c> clause,
        which is executed after the <c>catch</c> clause.

      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Nested Try/Catch</title>
      <p>
        Nested try blocks must be used to perform binary I/O correctly.
        The outer block encapsulates statements that throw <c>IOException</c> s.
        The inner block encapsulates the read loop and catches the <c>EOFException</c>. 
        No particular action need be taken when the <c>EOFException</c> is caught.

      Given the methods we wrote in the previous section,
      we can now specify the overall design of the <c>BinaryIO</c> class 
      (<xref ref="fig-binaryIO">Figure</xref>).
      The program sets up the same interface we used in the text file example (<xref ref="fig-binaryUI">Figure</xref>).
      It allows<nbsp/>the user to specify the name of a data file to read or write.
      One button allows the user to write random employee records to a binary file,
      and the other allows the user to display the contents of a file in a <c>JTextArea</c>. 
      The <c>BinaryIO</c> program in <xref ref="fig-binaryioclass">Figure</xref> 
      incorporates both <c>readRecords()</c> and <c>writeRecords()</c> into a complete Java program.

    <title>Abstracting Data from Files</title>
    <p>
      It's important to recognize that the method to read a binary file must exactly match the order of the write and read statements of the method that wrote the binary file.
      For example,
      if the file contains records that consist of a <c>String</c> followed by an <c>int</c> followed by a <c>double</c>, then they must be written by a sequence consisting of
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
writeUTF();
writeInt():
writeDouble();
 </input></program>
    <p>
      And they must thereafter be read by the sequence of
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
readUTF();
readInt():
readDouble();
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Attempting to do otherwise would make it impossible to interpret the data in the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point should make it evident why (non-Java) binary files are not portable  whereas text files are.
      With text files, each character consists of 8 bits,
      and each 8-bit chunk can be interpreted as an ASCII character.
      So even though a text file consists of a long sequence of 0's and 1's, we know how to find 
      the boundaries between each character.
      That's why any text editor can read a text file,
      no matter what program created it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand,
      binary files are also just a long sequence of 0's and 1's, but we can't tell 
      where one data element begins and another one ends.
      For example, the 64-bit sequence
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
010100110011001001010100110011000
010100110011001011010100110011000
 </input></program>
    <p>
      could represent two 32-bit <c>int</c>s or two 32-bit <c>float</c>s or one 64-bit double or four 16-bit <c>char</c>s 
      or a single <c>String</c> of 8 ASCII characters.
      We can't tell what data we have unless we know exactly how the data were written.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Interpreting Binary Data</title>
      <p>
        The fact that you can read the data in a binary file is no guarantee that you are interpreting it correctly.
        To interpret it correctly, you must read it the same way it was written.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Data Abstraction</title>
      <p>
        Binary data are
        <q>raw.</q>
        They have no inherent structure.
        It is only the programs that read and write the data that provide them with structure.
        A string of 64 0's and 1's can be interpreted as two <c>int</c> s or one <c>long</c> or even as some kind of object,
        so an <c>int</c>, <c>long</c> or an object is an abstraction imposed upon the data by the program.
      </p>
