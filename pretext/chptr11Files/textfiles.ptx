  <title>CASE STUDY: Reading and Writing Text Files</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let's write a GUI application that will be able to read and write data to and from a text file.
      To do this, we will need to develop a set of methods to perform I/O on text files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GUI for this application will contain a <c>JTextArea</c>, where text  file data can be input and displayed,
      and a <c>JTextField</c>, where the user can enter the file's name.
      It will also contain two
      <c>JButton</c>s, one for reading a file into the <c>JTextArea</c>, and the other for 
      writing the data in the <c>JTextArea</c> into a file (<xref ref="fig-guitextio">Figure</xref>).
      Note that even this simple interface will let the user create new files and rename existing files.

  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Text File Format</title>
    <p>
      A text file consists of a sequence of characters divided into zero or more lines and ending with a special
      <term>end-of-file character</term>.
          <idx><h>end-of-file character</h></idx>
       When you open a new file in a text editor,
      it contains zero lines and zero characters.
      After typing a single character,
      it would contain one character and one line.
      The following would be an example of a file with four lines of text:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\n\eof
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Note the use of the end-of-line character,
      <c>\n</c>, to mark the end of each line,
      and the use of the end-of-file character,
      <c>\eof</c>, to mark the end of the file.
      As we'll see,
      the I/O methods for text files use these special characters to control reading and writing loops.
      Thus, when the file is read by appropriate Java methods,
      such as the <c>BufferedReader.readLine()</c> and <c>BufferedReader.read()</c> methods,
      one or more characters will be read until either an end-of-line or end-of-file character is encountered.
      When a line of characters is written using <c>println()</c>, the end-of-line character is 
      appended to the characters themselves.
    </p>

    <title>Writing to a Text File</title>
      <p>
        Let's see how to write to a text file.
        In this program we write the entire contents of the <c>JTextArea</c> to the text file.
        In general, writing data to a file requires three steps:
      </p>
<algorithm>
<title>Writing to a file</title>
<program language="java"><input>
        Connect an output stream to the file.
        Write text data into the stream,possibly using a loop.
        Close the stream.
</input></program>
</algorithm>
      <p>
        As <xref ref="fig-systemout">Figure</xref> shows,
        connecting a stream to a file looks like doing a bit of plumbing.
        The first step is to connect an output stream to the file.
        The output stream serves as  a conduit between the program and a named file.
        The output stream opens the file and gets it ready to accept data from the program.
        If the file already exists,
        then opening the file will destroy any data it previously contained.
        If the file doesn't yet exist,
        then it will be created from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the file is open, the next step is to write the text to the stream,
        which passes the text on to the file.
        This step might require a loop that outputs one line of data on each iteration.
        Finally, once all the data have been written to the file,
        the stream should be closed.
        This also has the effect of closing the file itself.
      </p>
      <principle>
        <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Writing a File</title>
        <p>
          Writing data to a file requires a three-step algorithm: 
          (1) Connect an output stream to the file, (2) write the data,
          and (3) close the file.
        </p>
      </principle>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Code Reuse: Designing an Output Method</title>
      <p>
        Now let's see how these three steps are done in Java.
        Suppose the text we want to write is contained in a <c>JTextArea</c>. Thus,
        we want a method that will write the contents of a <c>JTextArea</c> to a named file.
      </p>
      <p>
        What output stream should we use for the task of writing a <c>String</c> to a named file?
        To decide this,
        we need to use the information in <xref ref="fig-streamhier">Figure</xref> and 
        <xref ref="tab-streams">Table</xref>.
        As we pointed out earlier, because we're writing a text file,
        we would use a <c>Writer</c> subclass.
        But which subclass should we use?
        One way to decide this is to consult the Java API documentation on 
        the <url href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/index.html" visual="">Oracle site</url>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For I/O operations you want to consult the classes in the <c>java.io</c> package.
        Ideally, we would like to be able to create an output stream to a named file,
        and we would like to be able to write a
        <c>String</c> to the file.
      </p>
      <p>
        One likely candidate is the <c>FileWriter</c> class (<xref ref="fig-filewriter">Figure</xref>).
        Its name and description (<xref ref="tab-streams">Table</xref>) suggest that it's designed for writing text files.
        And indeed it contains the kind of constructor we need<mdash/>that is,
        one that takes the file name as a parameter.
        Note that by taking a <c>boolean</c> parameter,
        the second constructor allows us to append data to a file rather than rewrite the entire file,
        which is the default case.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, <c>FileWriter</c> doesn't have a <c>write()</c> method.
        This doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't contain such a method.
        It might have inherited one from its superclasses, <c>OutputStreamWriter</c> and <c>Writer</c>. Indeed,
        the <c>Writer</c> class contains a method, <c>write()</c>, whose signature suggests 
        that it is ideally suited for our task (<xref ref="fig-filewriter">Figure</xref>).
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-filewriter">
        <caption>To find the right I/O method, it is sometimes
        necessary to search the Java class hierarchy. This is
        easy to do with the online documentation.</caption>
        <image width="60%" source="chptr11/filewriter.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Having decided on a <c>FileWriter</c> stream,
        the rest of the task of designing our method is simply a matter of using
        <c>FileWriter</c> methods in an appropriate way:
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
private void writeTextFile(JTextArea display, String fileName) {
    FileWriter outStream = new FileWriter(fileName);    // Create stream &amp; open file
    outStream.write(display.getText());                 //  Write the entire display text
    outStream.close();                                  //  Close the stream amp;
}
 </input></program>
      <p>
        We use the <c>FileWriter()</c> constructor to create an output stream to the file whose 
        name is stored in <c>fileName</c>. In this case,
        the task of writing data to the file is handled by a single <c>write()</c> statement,
        which writes the entire contents of the <c>JTextArea</c> in one operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, once we have finished writing the data,
        we <c>close()</c> the output stream.
        This also has the effect of closing the file.
        The overall effect of this method is that the text contained in
        <c>display</c> has been output to a file,
        named <c>fileName</c>, which is stored on the disk.
      </p>
      <principle>
        <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: Closing a File</title>
        <p>
          Even though Java will close any apen files and streams when a program terminates normally,
          it is good programming practice to close the file yourself with a <c>close()</c> statement.
          It also reduces the chances of damaging the file if the program terminates abnormally.
        </p>
      </principle>
      <p>
        Because so many different things can go wrong during an I/O operation,
        most I/O operations generate some kind of
        <em>checked exception</em>.
        Therefore, it is necessary to embed the I/O operations within a <c>try/catch</c> statement.
        In this example,
        the <c>FileWriter()</c> constructor,
        the <c>write()</c> method,
        and the <c>close()</c> method may each throw an <c>IOException</c>. Therefore,
        the entire body of this method should be embedded within a <c>try/catch</c> block that catches the
        <c>IOException</c>(<xref ref="fig-writetextmethod">Listing</xref>).
      </p>
<listing xml:id="fig-writetextmethod">
<caption>A method to write a text file.</caption>
        
 <program language="java"><input>

  try {
      FileWriter outStream =  new FileWriter (fileName);
      outStream.write (display.getText());
      outStream.close();
  } catch (IOException e) {
      display.setText("IOERROR: " + e.getMessage() + "\n");
      e.printStackTrace();
  }
} // writeTextFile()
 </input></program>

    <title>Code Reuse: Designing Text File Output</title>
    <p>
      The <c>writeTextFile()</c> method provides a simple example of how to write data to a text file.
      More importantly,
      its development illustrates the kinds of choices necessary to design effective I/O methods.
      Two important design questions we asked and answered were
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            What methods do we need to perform the desired task?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What streams contain the desired methods?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      As in so many other examples we've considered,  designing a method to perform a task 
      is often a matter of finding the appropriate methods in the Java class hierarchy.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Code Reuse</title>
      <p>
        Developing effective I/O routines is primarily a matter of choosing the right library methods.
        Start by asking yourself,
        <q>What methods do I need?</q>
        and then find a stream class that contains the appropriate methods.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      As you might expect,
      there is more than one way to write data to a text file.
      Suppose we decided that writing text to a file is like printing data to <c>System.out</c>. 
      And suppose we chose to use a <c>PrintWriter</c> object as our first candidate for an output stream
      (<xref ref="fig-printwriter">Figure</xref>).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-printwriter">
      <caption>The <c>PrintWriter</c> class.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="chptr11/printwriter.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>    
      This class contains a wide range of <c>print()</c> 
      methods for writing different types of data as text.
      So it has exactly the kind of method we need: <c>print(String)</c>. However,
      this stream does not contain a constructor method that allows us to create a stream from the name of a file.
      Its constructors require either a
      <c>Writer</c> object or an <c>OutputStream</c> object.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-fileoutput">
      <caption>The <c>FileOutputStream</c> class.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr11/fileoutput.png"/>
    </figure>    
    <p>
      This means that we can use a <c>PrintWriter</c> to print to a file,
      but only if we can first construct either an <c>OutputStream</c> or a <c>Writer</c> object to the file.
      Fortunately,
      the <c>FileOutputStream</c> class (<xref ref="fig-fileoutput">Figure</xref>) has just the constructors we want.
      We now have an alternative way of coding the <c>writeTextFile()</c> method,
      this time using a combination of <c>PrintWriter</c> and
      <c>FileOutputStream</c>:
    </p>
    <algorithm>
    <title>Writing to a textfile</title>
 <program language="java"><input>
                                    
PrintWriter outStream =                  //  Create an output stream
    new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(fileName)); //  and open the file
outStream.print ( display.getText() );               // Write the text
outStream.close();                                   // Close the stream
 </input></program>                     
</algorithm>
    <p>
      Note how the output stream is created in this case.
      First, we create a <c>FileOutputStream</c> using the file name as its argument.
      Then we create a <c>PrintWriter</c> using the <c>FileOutputStream</c> as its argument.
      The reason we can do this is  because the <c>PrintWriter()</c> constructor takes a
      <c>FileOutputStream</c> parameter.
      This is what makes the connection possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use the plumbing analogy again,
      this is like connecting two sections of pipe between the program and the file.
      The data will flow from the program through <c>PrintWriter</c>, through the <c>OutputStream</c>, to the file.
      Of course, you can't just arbitrarily connect one stream to another.
      They have to <q>fit together,</q>
      which means that their parameters have to match.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Stream/Stream Connections</title>
      <p>
        Two different kinds of streams can be connected if a constructor for one stream 
        takes the second kind of stream as a parameter.
        This is often an effective way to create the kind of object you need to perform an I/O task.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      The important lesson here is that we found what we wanted by searching through the <c>java.io.*</c> hierarchy.
      This same approach can be used to help you to design I/O methods for other tasks.

    <title>Reading from a Text File</title>
    <p>
      Let's now look at the problem of inputting data from an existing text file,
      a common operation that occurs whenever your email program opens an email message 
      or your word processor opens a document.
      In general, there are three steps to reading data from a file:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Connect an input stream to the file.</p></li>
      <li><p>Read the text data using a loop.</p></li>
      <li><p>Close the stream.</p></li>

      <caption>A stream serves as a pipe through which
      data flow.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr11/filestream.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      As <xref ref="fig-readfromstream">Figure</xref> shows,
      the input stream serves as a kind of pipe between the file and the
      program.
      The first step is to connect an input stream to the file.
      Of course, in order to read a file, the file must exist.
      The input stream serves as a conduit between the program and the named file.
      It opens the file and gets it ready for reading.
      Once the file is open, the next step is to read the file's data.
      This will usually require a loop that reads data until the end of the file is reached.
      Finally, once all the data are read,
      the stream should be closed.

      <p>
        Reading data from a file requires a three-step algorithm: (1) Connect an input stream to the file, (2) read the data,
        and (3) close the file.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Now let's see how these three steps are done in Java.
      Suppose that we want to put the file's data into a <c>JTextArea</c>. Thus,
      we want a method that will be given the name of a file and a reference to a <c>JTextArea</c>, and 
      it will read the data from the file into the <c>JTextArea</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What input stream should we use for this task?
      Here again we  need to use the information in <xref ref="fig-streamhier">Figure</xref> and
      <xref ref="tab-streams">Table</xref>.
      Because we're reading a text file,
      we should use a <c>Reader</c> subclass.
      A good candidate is the <c>FileReader</c>, whose name and description suggest that it might contain useful methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      What methods do we need?
      As in the previous example,
      we need a constructor method that connects an input stream to a file when the constructor is given the  name of the file.
      And, ideally,
      we'd like to have a method that will read one line at a time from the text file.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-filereader">
      <caption><c>FileReader</c>'s superclasses contain
      <c>read()</c> methods but no <c>readLine()</c> methods.</caption>
      <image width="60%" source="chptr11/filereader.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The <c>FileReader</c> class (<xref ref="fig-filereader">Figure</xref>) has the right kind of constructor.
      However, it contains no <c>readLine()</c> methods itself,
      which would be necessary for our purposes.
      Searching upward through its superclasses,
      we find that InputStreamReader , its immediate parent class,
      has a method that reads <c>int</c>s:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public int read() throws IOException();
 </input></program>
    <p>
      As shown in <xref ref="fig-filereader">Figure</xref>,
      this <c>read()</c> method is an override of the <c>read()</c> method defined in the <c>Reader</c> class,
      the root class for text file input streams.
      Thus, there are no <c>readLine()</c> methods in the <c>Reader</c> branch of the hierarchy.
      We have to look elsewhere for an appropriate class.
    </p>
    <p>
      One class that does contain a <c>readLine()</c> method is <c>BufferedReader</c>(Fig.
      <xref ref="fig-filereader"></xref>).
      Can we somehow use it?
      Fortunately,
      the answer is yes. <c>BufferedReader</c>'s constructor takes a <c>Reader</c> object as a parameter.
      But a <c>FileReader</c><em>is</em>
      a <c>Reader</c><mdash/>that is,
      it is a descendant of the <c>Reader</c> class.
      So, to use our plumbing analogy again,
      to build an input stream to the file,
      we can join a <c>BufferedReader</c> and a <c>FileReader</c>
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
BufferedReader inStream
    = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName));
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Given this sort of connection to the file,
      the program can use <c>BufferedReader.readLine()</c> to read one line at a time from the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we have found a method that reads one line at a time.
      Now we need an algorithm that will read the entire file.
      Of course, this will involve a loop,
      and the key will be to make sure we get the loop's termination condition correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important fact about <c>readLine()</c> is that it will return <c>null</c> as its value when it reaches the end of the file.
      Recall that text files have a special end-of-file character.
      When <c>readLine()</c> encounters this character,
      it will return
<c>null</c>. Therefore,
      we can specify the following <c>while</c> loop:
    </p>
<algorithm>
<title>Reading a text file</title>
 <program language="java"><input>
String line = inStream.readLine();
while (line != null) {
    display.append(line + "\n");
    line = inStream.readLine();
}
 </input></program>
 </algorithm>
    <p>
      We begin outside the loop by attempting to read a line from the file.
      If the file happens to be empty
      (which it might be),
      then <c>line</c> will be set to <c>null</c>; otherwise it will contain the <c>String</c> that was read.
      In this case,
      we append the line to a <c>JTextArea</c>. Note that <c>readLine()</c><em>does not</em>
      return the end-of-line character with its return value.
      That's why we add a <c>\n</c> before we append the line to the <c>JTextArea</c>.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: End of Line</title>
      <p>
        Remember that <c>readLine()</c> does not return the end-of-line character as part of the text it returns.
        If you want to print the text on separate lines,
        you must append <m>\backslash</m>n.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      The last statement in the body of the loop attempts to read the next line from the input stream.
      If the end of file has been reached,
      this attempt will return <c>null</c> and the loop will terminate.
      Otherwise, the loop will continue reading and displaying lines until the end of file is reached.
      Taken together,
      these various design decisions lead to the definition for <c>readTextFile()</c> 
      shown in <xref ref="fig-readtextmethod">Listing</xref>.
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-readtextmethod">
      <caption>A method for reading a text file.</caption>
 <program language="java"><input>
private void readTextFile(JTextArea display,
                                    String fileName) {
 try {
  BufferedReader inStream  // Create and open the stream
      = new BufferedReader (new FileReader(fileName));
  String line = inStream.readLine(); // Read one line

  } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {

   display.setText("IOERROR: " + e.getMessage() + "\n");
   e.printStackTrace();
  }

 </input></program>
    </listing>
    <p>
      Note that we must catch both the <c>IOException</c>, thrown by <c>readLine()</c> 
      and <c>close()</c>, and the <c>FileNotFoundException</c>, thrown by the <c>FileReader()</c> constructor.
      It's important to see that the read loop has the following form:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
try to read one line of data  and store it in line     // Loop initializer
while ( line is not null ) {                           // Loop entry condition
    process the data
    try to read one line of data and store it in line  // Loop updater
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      When it attempts to read the <em>end-of-file</em>
      character, <c>readLine()</c> will return <c>null</c>.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Reading Text</title>
      <p>
        In reading text files,
        the <c>readLine()</c> method will return <c>null</c> when it tries to read the end-of-file character.
        This provides a convenient way of testing for the end of file.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Reading an Empty File</title>
      <p>
        Loops for reading text files are designed to work even if the file is empty.
        Therefore, the loop should attempt to read a line <term>before</term>
        testing the loop-entry condition.
        If the initial read returns <c>null</c>, that means the file is empty and the loop body will be skipped.

    <title>Code Reuse: Designing Text File Input</title>
    <p>
      Our last example used <c>BufferedReader.readLine()</c> to read an entire line from the file in one operation.
      But this isn't the only way to do things.
      For example,
      we could use the <c>FileReader</c> stream directly if we were willing to do without the <c>readLine()</c> method.
      Let's design an algorithm that works in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we saw earlier,
      if you use a <c>FileReader</c> stream,
      then you must use the <c>InputStreamReader.read()</c> method.
      This method reads bytes from an input stream and translates them into Java Unicode characters.
      The <c>read()</c> method,
      for example,
      returns a single Unicode character as an <c>int</c>:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
public int read() throws IOException();
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Of course, we can always convert this to a <c>char</c> and concatenate it to a <c>JTextArea</c>, 
      as the following algorithm illustrates:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
int ch = inStream.read(); // Init: Try to read a character
while (ch != -1) { // Entry-condition: while more chars
    display.append((char)ch + ""); // Append the character
    ch = inStream.read();   // Updater: try to read
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Although the details are different,
      the structure of this loop is the same as if we were reading one line at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loop variable in this case is an <c>int</c> because <c>InputStreamReader.read()</c> 
      returns the next character as an <c>int</c>, or it returns <m>-1</m> if it encounters 
      the <c>end-of-file</c> character.
      Because <c>ch</c> is an <c>int</c>, we must convert it to a
      <c>char</c> and then to a <c>String</c> in order to <c>append()</c> it to the display.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loop to read data from a file has the following basic form:
    </p>
<algorithm>
<title>Read data loop</title>
 <program language="java"><input>
try to read data into a variable      // Initializer
while ( read was successful ) {       // Entry condition
    process the data
    try to read data into a variable // Updater
}
 </input></program>
 </algorithm>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Read Loop Structure</title>
      <p>
        The <c>read()</c> and
        <c>readLine()</c> methods have different ways to indicate when a read attempt fails.
        These differences affect how the loop-entry condition is specified,
        but the structure of the read loop is the same.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <principle>
      <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: Read Versus Readline</title>
      <p>
        Unless it is necessary to manipulate each character in the text file,
        reading a line at a time is more efficient and, therefore,
        preferable.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      It is worth noting again the point we made earlier: Designing effective I/O routines is 
      largely a matter of searching the
      <c>java.io</c> package for appropriate classes and methods.
      The methods we've developed can serve as suitable models for a wide variety of text I/O tasks,
      but if you find that they aren't suitable for a particular task,
      you can design your own method.
      Just think about what it is you want the program to accomplish,
      then find the stream classes that contain methods you can use to perform the desired task.
      Basic  reading and writing algorithms will be pretty much the same no matter which particular read or write method you use.
