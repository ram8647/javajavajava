  <title>Using File Data in Programs</title>
  <p>
    This chapter's examples have provided explicit details for several ways of writing data to files and reading data from files.
    In actual programs,
    deciding if and how files might be useful in the program are worked out as part of the design process.
    Choosing between text files, binary files,
    and reading and writing objects is part of this process.
  </p>
  <p>
    To illustrate how we can apply what we've learned about file I/O, let's modify the <c>WordGuess</c> class
    (<xref ref="fig-wordguess">Listing</xref>)
    so that it reads a list of possible words for players to guess from a file.
    The Chapter<nbsp/>8  version of the class contains a method, <c>getSecretWord()</c>, which uses a <c>switch</c> statement to randomly choose and return a word from a fixed list of ten words.
    Reading the words from a text file would allow a user to modify the list of possible words by adding or changing words without needing to recompile the program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's modify the <c>WordGuess</c> class in three ways:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          adding two new instance variables,
          an array of type <c>String</c> and a variable to store the size of the array;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          adding code at the beginning of the class's constructor to read words from the file and store them in the array;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          rewrite the <c>getSecretWord()</c> method so that it randomly chooses a word from the array.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us first choose descriptive names for  declaring the two new instance variables:
  </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
private String[] wordArray;
private int arraySize;
 </input></program>
  <p>
    Note that it will be useful to store the number of words in the file in its first line so that 
    this information can be used to allocate memory for the array.
    For example,
    let us assume the text file will be named <c>secretwords.txt</c>, it will be located in the same 
    directory as the <c>WordGuess</c> class,
    it will have the number of words in the file as its first line,
    and it will have  a single word per line after that.
    Thus, a small file might look like:
  </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
3
    STREAMS
    CONDUIT
    DIALOGS
 </input></program>
  <p>
    We can use the body of the <c>readTextFile()</c> method of the <c>TextIO</c> class as a model for 
    the Java code that needs to be added to the <c>WordGuess</c> constructor.
    Pseudocode for this code will look like:
  </p>
  <algorithm>
  <title>Read textfile algorithm</title>
 <program language="java"><input>
    Use file name to open a  BufferedReader stream
    Read first line and convert to an integer
    Store the integer as the size of the array
    Allocate memory for the array
    Read second line of file
    While a word is read
       Store the word in the next array element
       Read next line of file
    Close the BufferedReader stream
 </input></program>
</algorithm>
  <p>
    When this pseudocode is translated into Java and inserted into a
    <c>try-catch</c> statement we get the code fragment in <xref ref="fig-wordguessfile">Listing</xref>.
  </p>
  <listing xml:id="fig-wordguessfile">
    <caption>Code added at beginning of the <c>WordGuess</c> constructor.</caption>
 <program language="java"><input>
    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader("secretwords.txt");
        BufferedReader inStream
            = new BufferedReader(fr);
        String line = inStream.readLine();
        arraySize = Integer.parseInt(line);
        wordArray = new String[arraySize];
        line = inStream.readLine();
        int k = 0;
        while((line != null) &amp;&amp; (k &lt; arraySize)){
            wordArray[k] = line;
            line = inStream.readLine();
            k++;
        } //while
        inStream.close();
    } catch(FileNotFoundException e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch(IOException e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    } //catch
 </input></program>
  </listing>
  <p>
    The new <c>getSecretWord()</c> method merely needs to generate a  random array 
    index and return the corresponding array element:
  </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
    private String getSecretWord() {
        int num = (int)(Math.random()*arraySize);
        return wordArray[num];
    } //getSecretWord()
 </input></program>
  <p>
    The only other modification that is needed for to complete new
    <c>WordGuess</c> class is to add an initial <c>import java.io.*;</c> statement so that the file 
    IO classes can be accessed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The earlier examples in this chapter can be used as models to enhance numerous 
    practical applications.
    GUI applications that involve a user's choice to load data from a file or save data 
    in a file should make use of the <c>JFileChooser</c> dialogs to initiate the file operations.
