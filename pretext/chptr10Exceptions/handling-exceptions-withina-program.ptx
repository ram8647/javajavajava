  <title>Handling Exceptions Within a Program</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This section will describe how to handle exceptions within the program rather than leaving them to be handled by the JVM.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Trying, Throwing, and Catching an Exception</title>
    <p>
      In Java, errors and other abnormal conditions are handled by throwing  and catching exceptions.
      When an error or an exceptional condition is detected,
      you can <em>throw an exception</em>
          <idx><h>throw an exception</h></idx>
      as a way of signaling the abnormal condition.
      This is like pulling the fire alarm.
      When an exception is thrown,
      an exception handler will catch the exception and deal with it (<xref ref="fig-exchand">Figure</xref>).
      We will discuss try blocks,
      which typically  are associated with catching exceptions, later in the section.

    </p>
   
    <p>
      If we go back to our <c>avgFirstN()</c> example,
      the typical way of handling this error in Java would be to throw an exception in the avgFirstN() method and catch it in the calling method.
      Of course, the calling method could be in the same object or it could belong to some other object.
      In the latter case,
      the detection of the error is separated from its handling.
      This division of labor opens up a wide range of possibilities.
      For example,
      a program could dedicate a single object to serve as the handler for all its exceptions.
      The object would be sort of like the program's fire department.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate Java's <c>try/throw/catch</c> mechanism,
      let's revisit the
<c>CalcAvgTest</c> program.
      The version shown in <xref ref="fig-calcavg2">Listing</xref>
      mimics the way Java's default exception handler works.
      If the <c>avgFirstN()</c> method is called with an argument that is zero or negative,
      an <c>IllegalArgumentException</c> is thrown.
      The exception is caught by the <c>catch</c> clause in the <c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c> method.
    </p>
    <program language="java"><input>
    try {
      CalcAverage ca = new CalcAverage();
      System.out.println( "AVG + " + ca.avgFirstN(0));
    }
    catch (IllegalArgumentException e) { // Exception Handler
      System.out.println(e.getMessage());
      e.printStackTrace();
      System.exit(0);
    }
  </input></program>
    <listing xml:id="fig-calcavg2">
      <caption>In this version of the <c>calcAvgTest</c> program, an
<c>IllegalArgumentException</c> thrown in <c>CalcAverage.avgFirstN()</c>, would be handled by the catch clause in
<c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c>.</caption>
      
 <program language="java" interactive="activecode"><input>
 class CalcAverage {
  /**
   * Precondition:  N > 0
   * Postcondition: avgFirstN() equals the average of (1+2+...+N)
   */
  public double avgFirstN(int N) {
    int sum = 0;
    if (N &lt;= 0)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("ERROR: Illegal argument");
    for (int k = 1; k &lt;= N; k++)
      sum += k;
    return sum/N;         // What if N is 0?
   } // avgFirstN()
 } // CalcAverage
public class CalcAvgTest {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    try {
      CalcAverage ca = new CalcAverage();
      System.out.println( "AVG + " + ca.avgFirstN(0));
    }
    catch (IllegalArgumentException e) { // Exception Handler
      System.out.println(e.getMessage());
      e.printStackTrace();
      System.exit(0);
    }
  }//main
}// CalcAvgTest
 </input></program>
</listing>
    <p>
      Let's go through this example step by step.
      The first thing to notice is that if the <c>CalcAverage.avgFirstN()</c> method has a zero or negative argument,
      it will <c>throw</c> an exception:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
if (N &lt;= 0)
   throw new IllegalArgumentException("ERROR: Illegal argument");
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Note the syntax of the <c>throw</c> statement.
      It creates a new <c>IllegalArgumentException</c> object and passes it a message that describes the error.
      This message becomes part of the exception object.
      It can be retrieved using the <c>getMessage()</c> method,
      which is inherited from the <c>Throwable</c> class (<xref ref="fig-excepthier"></xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      When a <c>throw</c> statement is executed,
      the JVM interrupts the normal execution of the program and searches for an exception handler.
      We will describe the details of this search shortly.
      In this case,
      the exception handler is the <c>catch</c> clause contained in the
<c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c> method:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {  // Exception Handler
   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   e.printStackTrace();
   System.exit(0);
}
 </input></program>
    <p>
      When an <c>IllegalArgumentException</c> is thrown,
      the statements within this <c>catch</c> clause are executed.
      The first statement uses the <c>getMessage()</c> method to print a copy of the error message.
      The second statement uses the <c>printStackTrace()</c> method,
      which is defined in <c>Throwable</c> and inherited by all <c>Exception</c> s, to print a trace of the method calls leading up to the exception.
      The last statement causes the program to terminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we run this program,
      the following output will be generated as a result of the illegal argument error:
    </p>
    
 <program language="java"><input>
ERROR: Can't average 0 elements
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ERROR: Illegal argument
   at java.lang.Throwable.fillInStackTrace(Native Method)
   at java.lang.Throwable.&lt;init>(Throwable.java:94)
   at java.lang.Exception.&lt;init>(Exception.java:42)
   at java.lang.RuntimeException.&lt;init>
                       (RuntimeException.java:47)
   at java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.&lt;init>
                       (IllegalArgumentException.java:43)
   at CalcAverage.avgFirstN(Compiled Code)
   at CalcAvgTest.main(CalcAvgTest.java:5)
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Thus, as in the previous example of Java's default exception handler,
      our exception handler also prints out a description of the error and a trace of the method calls that led up to the error.
      However, in this example,
      we are directly handling the exception rather than leaving it up to Java's default exception handler.
      Of course, this example is intended mainly for illustrative purposes.
      It would make little sense to write our own exception handler if it does nothing more than mimic Java's default handler.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Using an Exception</title>
      <p>
        Unless your program's handling of an exception is significantly different from Java's default handling of it,
        the program should just rely on the default.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      Finally, note that the <c>catch</c> clause is associated with a
<c>try</c> block.
      The handling of exceptions in Java takes place in two parts: First,
      we <em>try</em> to execute some statements,
      which may or may not lead to an exception.
      These are the statements contained within the <c>try</c> clause:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
try {
    CalcAverage ca = new CalcAverage();
    System.out.println( "AVG + " + ca.avgFirstN(0));        
  }
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Second, we provide one or more <c>catch</c> clauses to handle particular types of exceptions.
      In this case,
      we are only handling <c>IllegalArgumentException</c> s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we said earlier,
      throwing an exception is like pulling a fire alarm.
      The throw occurs somewhere within the scope of the <c>try</c> block.
      The
      <q>fire department</q>
      in this case is the code contained in the <c>catch</c> clause that immediately follows the try block.
      This is the  exception handler for this particular exception.
      There's something like a game of catch going on here: Some method within the try block throws an <c>Exception</c> object,
      which is caught and handled by the catch block located in some other object (<xref ref="fig-exccatch"></xref>).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-exccatch">
      <caption>Playing catch: In this design,
      the <c>IllegalArgumentException</c> is thrown
      by the <c>CalcAverage.avgFirstN()</c> method and caught by the catch
      clause within <c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c> method.</caption>

  <subsection>
    <title>Separating Error Checking from Error Handling</title>
    <p>
      As we see in the <c>CalcAvgTest</c> example,
      an important difference between Java's exception handling and  more traditional approaches is that error handling can be separated from the normal flow of execution within a program.
      The <c>CalcAverage.avgFirstN()</c> method still checks for the error and it still <c>throws</c><c>IllegalArgumentException</c> if <em>N</em>
      does not satisfy the method's precondition.
      But it does not contain code for handling the exception.
      The exception-handling code is located in the
<c>CalcAvgTest</c> class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the <c>CalcAvgTest</c> program creates a clear separation between the normal algorithm and the exception-handling code.
      One advantage of this design is that the normal algorithm is uncluttered by error-handling code and,
      therefore, easier to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another advantage is that the program's response to errors has been organized into one central location.
      By locating the exception handler in <c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c>, one exception handler can be used to handle other errors of that type.
      For example, this catch clause could handle
      <em>all</em><c>IllegalArgumentException</c> s that get thrown in the program.
      Its use of <c>printStackTrace()</c> will identify exactly where the exception occurred.
      In fact, because a Java application starts in the <c>main()</c> method,
      encapsulating all of a program's executable statements within a single <c>try</c> block in the <c>main()</c> method will effectively handle all the exceptions that occur within a program.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Normal Versus Exceptional Code</title>
      <p>
        A key element of Java's exception-handling mechanism is that the exception handler<mdash/>the catch block<mdash/>is distinct from the code that throws the exception<mdash/>the try block.
        The try block contains the normal algorithm.
        The catch block contains code for handling exceptional conditions.
      </p>
    </principle>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Syntax and Semantics of Try/Throw/Catch</title>
    <p>
      A <term>try block</term>
          <idx><h>try block</h></idx>
      begins with the keyword <c>try</c> followed by a block  of code enclosed within curly braces.
      A <em>catch clause</em> or <em>catch block</em>
          <idx><h>catch block</h></idx>
      consists of the keyword <c>catch</c>, followed by a parameter declaration that identifies the type of <c>Exception</c> being caught,
      followed by a collection of statements enclosed within curly braces.
      These are the statements that  handle the exception by taking appropriate action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an exception is thrown,
      control is transferred out of the try block to an appropriate catch block.
      Control does not return to the try block.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Try Block Control</title>
      <p>
        If an exception is thrown,
        the try block is exited and control does not return to it.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      The complete syntax of the <c>try/catch</c> statement is summarized in <xref ref="fig-trystmt">Listing</xref>.
 
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-trystmt">
      <caption>Java's try/catch statement.</caption>
 <program language="java"><input>
try {
      // Block of statements
      // At least one of which may throw an exception
      if ( /* Some condition obtains */ )
          throw new ExceptionName();
 } catch (ExceptionName ParameterName) {
     // Block of statements to be executed
     // If the ExceptionName exception is thrown in try
 }  catch (ExceptionName2 ParameterName) {
     // Block of statements to be executed
     // If the ExceptionName2 exception is thrown in try
...  // Possibly other catch clauses
 } finally {
     // Optional block of statements that is executed
     // Whether an exception is thrown or not
 }
 </input></program>
</listing>
    <p>
      The try block is meant to     include a statement or statements that might throw an exception.
      The catch blocks<mdash/>there can be one or more<mdash/>are meant to handle exceptions that are thrown in the try block.
      A catch block will handle any exception that matches its parameter class,
      including subclasses of that class.
      The <term>finally block</term> clause is an optional clause that is always executed,
      whether an exception is thrown or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statements in the try block are part of the program's normal flow  of execution.
      By encapsulating a group of statements within a try block,
      you thereby indicate that one or more exceptions may be thrown by those statements,
      and that you intend to catch them.
      In effect, you are <em>trying</em>
      a block of code with the possibility that something might go wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an exception is thrown within a try block, Java exits the block and  transfers control to the first <c>catch</c> block that matches the particular kind of exception that was thrown.
      Exceptions are thrown by using the <c>throw</c> statement,
      which takes the following general form:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
throw new ExceptionClassName(OptionalMessageString);
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The keyword <c>throw</c> is followed by the instantiation of an object of the <c>ExceptionClassName</c> class.
      This is done the same way we instantiate any object in Java:
      by using the <c>new</c> operator and invoking one of the exception's constructor methods.
      Some of the constructors take an <c>OptionalMessageString</c>, which is the message that gets returned by the exception's <c>getMessage()</c> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <c>catch</c> block has the following general form:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
catch (ExceptionClassName ParameterName) {
    // Exception handling statements
  }
 </input></program>
    <p>
      A <c>catch</c> block is very much like a method definition.
      It contains a parameter,
      which specifies the class of exception that is handled by that block.
      The <em>ParameterName</em> can be any valid identifier,
      but it is customary to use <c>e</c> as the <c>catch</c> block parameter.
      The parameter's scope is limited to the catch block,
      and it is used to refer to the caught exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>ExceptionClassName</em>
      must be one of the classes in Java's  exception hierarchy
      (see 
      <xref ref="fig-excepthier"></xref>).
      A thrown exception will match any parameter of its own class or any of its superclasses.
      Thus, if an <c>ArithmeticException</c> is thrown,
      it will match both an <c>ArithmeticException</c> parameter and an <c>Exception</c> parameter,
      because <c>ArithmeticException</c> is a subclass of <c>Exception</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that there can be multiple <c>catch</c> clauses associated with a given <c>try</c> block,
      and the order with which they are arranged is important.
      A thrown exception will be caught by the first <c>catch</c> clause it matches.
      Therefore, <c>catch</c> clauses  should be arranged in order from most specific to most general (See the exception hierarchy in <xref ref="fig-excepthier">Figure</xref>).
      If a more general catch clause precedes a more specific one,
      it will prevent the more specific one from executing.
      In effect, the more specific clause will be hidden by the more general one.
      You might as well just not have the more specific clause at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate how to arrange catch clauses,
      suppose an
<c>ArithmeticException</c> is thrown in the following <c>try/catch</c> statement:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
try {
     // Suppose an ArithmeticException is thrown here} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
     System.out.println("ERROR: " + e.getMessage() );
     e.printStackTrace();
     System.exit(1);} catch (Exception e) {
     System.out.println("ERROR: " + e.getMessage() );
    }
 </input></program>
    <p>
      In this case,
      the exception would be handled by the more specific <c>ArithmeticException</c> block.
      On the other hand, if some other kind of exception is raised,
      it will be caught by the second  catch clause.
      The <c>Exception</c> class will match any exception that is thrown.
      Therefore, it should always occur last in a sequence of
<c>catch</c> clauses.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: Arranging Catch Clauses</title>
      <p>
        Catch clauses should be arranged from most specific to most general.
        The <c>Exception</c> clause should always be the last in the sequence.
      </p>
    </principle>

  <subsection>
    <title>Restrictions on the <c>try/catch/finally</c>
    Statement</title>
    <p>
      There are several important restrictions that apply to Java's exception-handling mechanism.
      We'll describe these in more detail later in this chapter.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A try block must be immediately followed by one or more catch clauses and a catch clause may only follow a try block.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <c>throw</c> statement is used to throw both checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions,
            where unchecked exceptions are those belonging to <c>RuntimeException</c> or its subclasses.
            Unchecked exceptions need not be caught by the program.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <c>throw</c> statement must be contained within the dynamic scope of a try block,
            and the type of <c>Exception</c> thrown must match at least one of the try block's catch clauses.
            Or the
<c>throw</c> statement must be contained within a method or constructor that has a <c>throws</c> clause for the type of thrown <c>Exception</c>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Try/Catch Syntax</title>
      <p>
        A try block must be followed immediately<mdash/>with no intervening code<mdash/>by one or more catch blocks.
        A catch block can only be preceded by a try block or by another catch block.
        You may not place intervening code between catch blocks.
      </p>
    </principle>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Dynamic Versus Static Scoping</title>
    <p>
      How does Java know that it should execute the <c>catch</c> clause in
<c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c> when an exception is thrown in <c>avgFirstN()</c>? Also,
      doesn't the latest version of <c>avgFirstN()</c>(<xref ref="fig-calcavg2">Listing</xref>) violate the restriction that a <c>throw</c> statement must occur within a try block?
    </p>
    <p>
      An exception can only be thrown within a
      <em>dynamically enclosing</em> try block.
      This means that the <c>throw</c> statement must fall within the
      <term>dynamic scope</term>
          <idx><h>dynamic scope</h></idx>
      of an enclosing try block.
      Let's see what  this means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamic scoping refers to the way a program is executed.
      For example,
      in <c>CalcAverage</c>(<xref ref="fig-calcavg2">Listing</xref>),
      the <c>avgFirstN()</c> method is called from within the try block located in <c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c>. Thus,
      it falls within the dynamic scope of that try block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrast dynamic with what you have learned about
      <term>static scope</term>,
          <idx><h>static scope</h></idx>
      which  we've used previously to define the scope of parameters and local variables 
      (<xref ref="fig-dynamic"></xref>).
      Static scoping refers to the way a program is written.
      A statement or variable occurs within the scope of a block if its 
      text is actually written within that block.
      
      <figure xml:id="fig-dynamic">
        <caption>Dynamic versus static scoping.  Static
        scoping refers to how the program is written.  Look at its definitions.
        Dynamic scoping refers to how the program executes.  Look at
        what it actually does.</caption>
        <image width="73%" source="chptr10/dynamic.png"/>
      </figure>

      For example,
      consider the definition of <c>MyClass</c>(<xref ref="fig-myclass">Listing</xref>).

      The variable <c>X</c> occurs within the (static) scope of <c>method1()</c>, and the variable <c>Y</c> occurs within the (static) scope of <c>method2()</c>.
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-myclass">
      <caption>An example of dynamic versus static scoping.</caption>
 <program language="java" interactive="activecode"><input>
public class MyClass {
    public void method1() {
        int X = 1;
        System.out.println("Hello" + X);
    }
    public void method2() {
        int Y = 2;
        System.out.println("Hello" + Y);
    }
    public static void main( String argv[] ) {
        MyClass myclass = new MyClass();
        if (Math.random() > 0.5)
            myclass.method2();
        else
            myclass.method1();
    }
  } // MyClass
 </input></program>
</listing>
 
    <p>
      A method's parameters and local variables occur within its static scope.
      Also, in the <c>MyClass</c> definition,
      the
<c>System.out.println()</c> statements occur within the static scope of
<c>method1()</c> and <c>method2()</c>, respectively.
      In general, static scoping refers to where a variable is declared or where a statement is located.
      Static scoping can be completely determined by just reading the program.
    </p>

      Dynamic scoping can only be determined by running the program.
      For example,
      in MyClass the order in which its statements are executed depends on the result of <c>Math.random()</c>. Suppose that when <c>random()</c> is executed it returns the value 0.99.
      In that case, <c>main()</c> will call <c>method2()</c>, which will call <c>System.out.println()</c>, which will print
      <q>Hello2.</q>
      In that case,
      the statement <c>System.out.println("Hello" + Y</c>) has the following dynamic scope:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
main()
    method2()
        System.out.println("Hello" + Y);
 </input></program>
 
    <p>
      It occurs within the (dynamic) scope of <c>method2()</c>, which is within the (dynamic) scope of <c>main()</c>. On the other hand,
      if the result of <c>random()</c> had been 0.10,
      that particular
<c>println()</c> statement wouldn't have been executed at all.
      Thus, to determine the dynamic scope of a particular statement,
      you must trace the program's execution.
      In fact, this is what the <c>printStackTrace()</c> method does.
      It prints a trace of a statement's dynamic scope.

    <title>Exception Propagation: Searching for a Catch Block</title>
    <p>
      When an exception is thrown, Java uses both static and dynamic scoping to find a catch clause to handle it.
      Java knows how the program is defined<mdash/>after all,
      it compiled it.
      Thus, the static scope of a program's methods is determined by the compiler.
      Java also places a record of every method call the program makes on a method call stack.
      A <term>method call stack</term>
          <idx><h>method call stack</h></idx>
      is a  data structure that behaves like a stack of dishes in the cafeteria.
      For each method call, a <em>method call block</em>
      is placed on top of the stack
      (like a dish),
      and when a particular method call returns,
      its block is removed from the top of the stack (<xref ref="fig-methodstack"></xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      An important feature of the method call stack is that the current executing method is always represented by the top block on the method call stack.
      If an exception happens during that method call,
      you can trace backward through the method calls,
      if necessary, to find an exception handler for that exception.
      In <xref ref="fig-methodstack">Figure</xref>,
      you can visualize this back trace as a matter of reversing the direction of the curved arrows.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-methodstack">
      <caption>The method call stack for the <c>Propagate</c>
      program.  The curved arrows give a trace of the method
      calls leading to the program's present state.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr16/stack.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In order to find a matching catch block for an exception, Java uses its knowledge of the program's static and dynamic scope to perform a
      <term>method stack trace</term>.
          <idx><h>method stack trace</h></idx>
      The basic idea is that Java  traces backward through the program until it finds an appropriate catch clause.
      The trace begins within the block that threw the exception.
      Of course, one block can be nested (statically) within another block.
      If the exception is not caught by the block in which it is thrown, Java searches the enclosing block.
      This is static scoping.
      If it is not caught within the enclosing block, Java searches the next higher enclosing block,
      and so on.
      This is still static scoping.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the exception is not caught at all within the method in which it was thrown, Java uses the method call stack 
      (<xref ref="fig-methodstack"></xref>) to search backward through the method calls that were made leading up to the exception.
      This is dynamic scoping.
      In the case of our <c>CalcAvgTest()</c> example (<xref ref="fig-calcavg2">Listing</xref>), Java would search backward to the <c>CalcAvgTest.main()</c> method,
      which is where <c>avgFirstN()</c> was called,
      and it would find the <c>catch</c> clause there for handling
<c>IllegalArgumentException</c> s.
      It would, therefore, execute that catch clause.
