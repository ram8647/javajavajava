  <title>A Command-Line Interface</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A command-line interface is perhaps the simplest, and most old-fashioned,
      way to design the interaction between a user and a program.
      According to this approach, user input is taken from the keyboard,
      and the program's output is displayed on some kind of console (<xref ref="fig-command-line"></xref>).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-command-line">
      <caption>A command-line user interface.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr04/cmdline.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The command-line approach might also be called
      <em>console interface</em>.
      In the early days of computers,
      before we had graphics-based computer monitors capable of displaying multiple windows,
      the console was the entire computer display.
      For today's computers the console might be a window provided by your programming environment,
      as in <xref ref="fig-console">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-console">
      <caption>The Java console window.</caption>
      <image width="63%" source="chptr04/console.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In Chapter 3 we described how to use the <c>System.out.print()</c> and
<c>System.out.println()</c> methods to output strings to the console.
      That takes care of the output side of command-line interface.
      The more challenging task is managing the input-side of the interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Java, input and output is handled by objects that are called <term>streams</term>.
      You can think of a stream as a kind of pipe through which data flow (<xref ref="fig-streams"></xref>).
      An <term>input stream</term>  carries data from some kind of input device,
      such as a keyboard or network connection or a file,
      to the program's main memory.
      An <em>output stream</em> carries data from the program's memory to some kind of output device,
      such as a printer or a file.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-streams">
      <caption>Input and output streams.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="chptr04/streams.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Each Java program has three standard streams available to it at startup: <c>System.in</c>, <c>System.out</c>, and <c>System.err</c>.
<c>System.in</c> is a predefined input stream that is typically associated with the keyboard (<xref ref="fig-streams"></xref>).
      That is, it carries data from the keyboard to the program. <c>System.out</c> and
<c>System.err</c> are both output streams typically associated with the console.
      They both carry data from the program to the console.
      The difference is simply that <c>System.out</c> is used for normal program output and <c>System.err</c> is used to output error messages.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Using a <c>BufferedReader</c> to Input Strings from the Keyboard</title>
    <p>
      We will use a <c>BufferedReader</c> object to handle data input from the keyboard.
      As its name implies,
      the <c>BufferedReader</c> class performs buffered input.
      A <term>buffer</term> is a portion of main memory where input is held until it is needed by the program.
      Using a  buffer between the keyboard and the program allows you to use the Backspace key to delete a character.
      When you hit the Enter key,
      any characters that you deleted will be ignored when the program retrieves characters from the input buffer.
      If the user's input were not buffered in this way,
      it would contain every keystroke, including the Backspaces,
      and then it would be up to the program to eliminate the characters that were supposed to be deleted.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-buffrdr">
      <caption>The <c>BufferedReader</c> class.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="chptr04/buffrdr.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-buffrdr">Figure</xref>
      provides a UML diagram of the <c>BufferedReader</c> class and shows its relationship to other the classes that will be used for keyboard input . Note that along with <c>InputStreamReader</c>, <c>BufferedReader</c> is one of several subclasses of the <c>Reader</c> class.
      As the diagram shows, <c>BufferedReader</c> has two important methods.
      Its constructor method takes a <c>Reader</c> parameter,
      which means that when we create a <c>BufferedReader</c> we must provide it with a reference to some kind of <c>Reader</c> object.
      To perform keyboard input,
      we want to provide a reference to an object that can read <c>System.in</c>, the standard input stream.
      As the figure shows, <c>InputStreamReader</c> has a constructor that allows it to read an <c>InputStream</c>. Therefore,
      to construct a <c>BufferedReader</c> that will read <c>System.in</c> we use the following statement:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader (System.in));
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      In this statement we are actually creating two objects.
      We first create an <c>InputStreamReader</c>, giving it a reference to
<c>System.in</c>. We then pass that object to a <c>BufferedReader</c>. The result is a cooperation between two objects that enables us to do buffered reading of the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating a <c>BufferedReader</c> in this way,
      whenever we use its
<c>readLine()</c> method,
      it will read a line of characters from the keyboard.
      For example,
      having created a <c>BufferedReader</c> named
<c>input</c>, the following code segment will read one line of input and assign it to the <c>String</c> variable named <c>inputString</c>.
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    String inputString = input.readLine();
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      When the program encounters the <c>readLine()</c> expression,  it will wait for the user to hit the Enter key.
      It will then input whatever the user typed,
      minus any characters that were Backspaced over,
      into the <c>String</c> variable.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Keyboard Input</title>
      <p>
        The <c>BufferedReader.readLine()</c> method allows the user to backspace over errors during keyboard input.
      </p>
    </principle>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Inputting Numbers from the Keyboard</title>
    <p>
      As the previous section showed,
      we can use a <c>BufferedReader</c> object to input <c>String</c> s from the keyboard.
      In Java, all keyboard input is represented as <c>String</c> s.
      However, what if we want to input numbers?
      The answer is that we have to extract numbers from the input strings.
      To do this, Java provides us two special classes,
      known as wrapper classes: <c>Integer</c> and <c>Double</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <term>wrapper class</term> contains methods for converting primitive  data into objects and for converting data from one type to another.
      The <c>Integer</c> class contains the <c>parseInt()</c> method,
      which extracts an <c>int</c> from its <c>String</c> argument.
      For example, in the following usage,
      the string "55" is converted into the number 55:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    int m = Integer.parseInt("55");
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      Similarly, the <c>Double</c> class contains the
<c>parseDouble()</c> method,
      which extracts a <c>double</c> value from its parameter.
      In this example,
      the number 55.2 is extracted from the string "55.2":
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    double num = Double.parseDouble("55.2");
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      If we are writing a program that requires us to input numbers from the keyboard,
      then assuming we have created a <c>BufferedReader</c> object named <c>input</c>, we can use these methods in combination with the <c>readLine()</c> method,
      to input and process numbers.
      For example, this code segment calculates a runner's race pace:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    String inputString = new String();
    System.out.println("How many total miles did you run? ");
    inputString = input.readLine();   // Input a String}
    double miles = Double.parseDouble(inputString); // Convert
    System.out.println("How many minutes did it take you? ");
    inputString = input.readLine();   // Input another String
    double minutes = Double.parseDouble(inString);  // Convert
    System.out.println("Your average pace was " + minutes/miles + " minutes per mile");
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      Notice how we included prompts in this example so that the user knows what type of input is expected.
      Designing appropriate prompts is an important aspect of designing a good user interface.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN:Prompting</title>
      <p>
        In a well-designed user interface,
        prompts should be used to guide the user through the input process.
      </p>
    </principle>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Designing a Keyboard Reader Class</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have introduced the library classes and methods that we will use for command-line input,
      lets design a class to encapsulate these functions.
      We want a class that will use a <c>BufferedReader</c> to read any kind of data<mdash/>strings,
      integers,
      or real numbers<mdash/>from keyboard.
      We also want this class to hide some of the messy details involved in performing keyboard input.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-keybrdrdr">
      <caption>Design of the <c>KeyboardReader</c> class.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr04/keybrdrdr.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-keybrdrdr">Figure</xref>
      presents the design of <c>KeyboardReader</c> class.
      Note that instances of this class will use a <c>BufferedReader</c> object to perform the actual keyboard input.
      That's why we need a private instance variable of type <c>BufferedReader</c>. The constructor method will create a <c>BufferedReader</c>, which will then be used whenever a read operation is requested.
      Note that the <c>KeyboardReader()</c> has five public methods.
      The <c>getKeyboardInput()</c> method returns a <c>String</c>. This is the method we will call when we just want to get the string that the user typed from the keyboard.
      The <c>getKeyboardInteger()</c> method returns an <c>int</c> value.
      This is the method we will call when we want an integer from the keyboard.
      Similarly, the <c>getKeyboardDouble()</c> method returns a
<c>double</c>. This is the method we will call when we want to input a floating point value from the keyboard.
      Finally, the <c>prompt()</c> and <c>display()</c> methods will be used to perform two other important tasks of a user interface:
      that of prompting the user and that of displaying the program's output.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following code segment illustrates how we will use a <c>KeyboardReader</c> object to input an integer:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    KeyboardReader cmdline = new KeyboardReader();
    int m = cmdline.getKeyboardInteger();
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      All we need to do is create an instance of the <c>KeyboardReader</c> and ask it to get an integer for us.
      This greatly simplifies the work we would have to do when we want to perform keyboard input.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <xref ref="fig-keybrdrdr">Figure</xref>
      lists a private method named <c>readKeyboard()</c> in the <c>KeyboardReader</c> class.
      This is the method that does the actual work of reading data from the keyboard.
      Because it is private,
      it can only be called by the other methods in <c>KeyboardReader</c>. It cannot be called by other classes.
      The reason we  make it private is to hide it,
      and the messy details of performing keyboard input, from other classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those messy details is the fact that whenever I/O is performed,
      it is possible for things to go wrong.
      The possibility of errors occurring applies to all forms of I/O, not just keyboard I/O. For example,
      when a program is trying to read a file,
      the file might be missing.
      Or when trying to download a web page,
      the Internet connection might malfunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because these types of external errors are possible, Java requires that whenever a program performs certain types of I/O, it must watch out for certain kinds of error conditions,
      known as <em>exceptions</em>.
      Exceptions are covered in Chapter<nbsp/>11,
      so we will not attempt to cover  them here.
      Instead, we will design the
<c>readKeyboard()</c> method to take care of this detail for us.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>Exceptions</title>
      <p>
        Java I/O methods require that programs check for certain error conditions during input.
      </p>
    </principle>

      <xref ref="fig-keybrdrdrclass">Listing</xref> gives the full implementation
      (for now)
      of the <c>KeyboardReader</c> class.

    import java.io.*;
    public class KeyboardReader
    {   private BufferedReader reader;
        public KeyboardReader() {
            reader = new BufferedReader
            (new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        } catch (IOException e)
        {  e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return line;
    }
  }
    </input>
</program>

    </listing>
    <p>
      Lets go through it line by line.
      The first thing to notice is the use of the <c>import</c> statement.
      Recall that importing a Java package enables us to refer to elements in the package by their short names (<c>BufferedReader</c>), rather than by their fully qualified names (<c>java.io.BufferedReader</c>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Next notice how we create a <c>BufferedReader</c> object in the <c>KeyboardReader()</c> constructor:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    reader = new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader (System.in));
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      The resulting <c>reader</c> object will persist as long as our <c>KeyboardReader</c> object exists and can be used for all subsequent input operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next notice the definition of the <c>readKeyboard()</c> method.
      It calls the inherited <c>readLine()</c> method to input a line from the keyboard and then it returns the line.
      Note, however,
      how the call to the <c>readLine()</c> method is embedded in a <c>try...catch</c> block.
      This is one way to handle the possibility that an exception might occur during the input operation.
      Java requires that our program do something to address the possibility of an I/O exception,
      and as we will learn in Chapter<nbsp/>11,
      there are other designs that we might have used here.
      The primary advantage of doing it this way is that we can hide this language detail from the rest of the program.
      The rest of the program<mdash/>and any other programs that use the <c>KeyboardReader</c> class<mdash/>will not have to worry about this exception issue.
      They can just ask the <c>KeyboardReader</c> to get them a string or an integer and it will deliver the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, notice how the public input methods are defined.
      The <c>getKeyboardInput()</c> method just returns the line that it gets by calling <c>readKeyboard()</c>. The <c>getKeyboardInteger()</c> method also calls <c>readKeyboard()</c>, but instead of just returning the line,
      it extracts an integer from it and returns the integer.
      The <c>getKeyboardDouble()</c> method works the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, notice how the public output methods are defined.
      Both the
<c>prompt()</c> and <c>display()</c> methods take a single <c>String</c> parameter and do exactly the same thing<ndash/>they merely print their string.
      So why do we have two methods when one will suffice?
      The answer is that these methods encapsulate important and distinct user-interface functions<mdash/>prompting the user and displaying output<mdash/>that just happen to be implemented in exactly the same way in this case.
      As we will see when we design our GUI interface,
      we will use completely different objects to prompt the user and display output.
      So, despite their similarities,
      it is important that we distinguish the task of prompting the user from the more general task of displaying output.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="self-study-exercisesA14">
    <title>Designing a Command-Line Interface</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have defined a special class for performing keyboard input,
      we now show how it can be used as a user interface in cooperation with the other objects that make up a program.
      As described in <xref ref="fig-ui">Figure</xref>,
      the user interface will serve as an intermediary between the user and some type of computational object.
      Although our command-line interface should work with any application,
      no matter how complex, we begin with a very simple computational problem.
      This will allow us to focus on the user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's design a program that prompts the user for his or her name and then says hello.
      Thus, the program's I/O should look like this:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
Hi, please input your name here > Kim
  Hi Kim, nice to meet you.
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      In the design we use there will be two primary objects involved.
      One will serve as the user interface.
      This will be our <c>KeyboardReader</c>. A second object will serve as the computational object.
      In this case it will
      <q>compute</q>
      an appropriate greeting.
      It will serve contain the <c>main()</c> method and will encapsulate the algorithm for this application.
      It will use a <c>KeyboardReader</c> to handle its I/O needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main advantage of this division of labor is that it enables us to use the <c>KeyboardReader</c>, as is,
      with virtually any Java application.
      Moreover, despite its simplicity,
      our computational object in this example can serve as a template for future programs.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN:Modularity</title>
      <p>
        By designing the user interface as a self-contained module,
        we can use it with just about any application.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-greeter">Figure</xref>
      provides the details the design we wish to implement.
      Note that <c>GreeterApp</c> contains an instance variable for a <c>KeyboardReader</c>. This will enable it to use the <c>KeyboardReader</c> whenever it needs to perform keyboard input.
      By giving
<c>GreeterApp</c> a <c>main()</c> method,
      we allow it to be the main class for our application.
      Its <c>run()</c> method will contain the algorithm that controls the application,
      and its <c>greet()</c> method will handle the task of greeting the user.

    <p>
      variable for the <c>KeyboardReader</c>, which is instantiated in the constructor method.
      This gives <c>GreeterApp</c> a way to refer directly to the user interface whenever it needs keyboard input.
      The
<c>run()</c> method encapsulates the application's algorithm.
      Notice how it uses the <c>KeyboardReader</c> to prompt the user,
      to input the user's name, and then to display the greeting.
      Finally, the <c>main()</c> method serves to create an instance of the computational object and calls its <c>run()</c> method.

    <p>
      To re-cap, we have designed a simple command-line interface that can be used,
      with minor changes,
      for virtually any programming task in subsequent chapters.
      Before moving on,
      it may be helpful to touch on some of the important object-oriented principles that went into our design.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Divide-and-conquer: We see the usefulness of dividing a program into separate objects,
            one to handle the computations required by the application,
            and one to handle the user interface.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Encapsulation: The classes we designed encapsulate just the information and behavior that is necessary to perform their specific roles.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Information hiding: We use a private method to hide certain messy implementation details from other parts of the program.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Generality and Extensibility: We have developed a design that is general enough that it can be extended to other applications.

            Java's <c>Math</c> class has a static method that will generate a random number
             between 0 and 0.99999999<mdash/>that is,
            between 0 and 1, not including 1.
            By using simple arithmetic,
            we can generate random numbers between any two values.
            For example,
            the following statement assigns a random integer between 1 and 100 to the 
            variable:


<program language="java">
    <input>
    secretNumber = 1 + (int)(Math.random() * 100);
    </input>
</program>
 Given this statement, design and implement an application that will play the following guessing game with the user.
 The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then lets the user guess the number,
 telling the user when the guess is too high or too low.
 Note that for this problem, the user will have to input integers at the keyboard, 
 so you will have to use a development environment with user input possible, like replit.
