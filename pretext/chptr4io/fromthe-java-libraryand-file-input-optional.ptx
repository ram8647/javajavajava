  <title>From the Java Library: <c>java.io.File</c>
  and File Input (Optional)</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In addition to command-line and GUI user interfaces,
      there is one more standard user interface, files.
      In this section we show how the <c>Scanner</c> class,
      that was used in Chapter<nbsp/>2 for keyboard input,
      can also read input from files.
      Reading input from a file is relevant to only certain types of programming problems.
      It is hard to imagine how a file would be used in playing the One Row Nim game but a file might very well be useful to store a collection of riddles that could be read and displayed by a Java program.
      We will develop such a program later in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Java has two types of files, <em>text files</em>
      and <em>binary files</em>.
      A <term>text file</term> stores a sequence of characters and is the type of file created by standard text editors like
      <em>NotePad</em> and <em>WordPad</em>
      on a Windows computer or <em>SimpleText</em> on a Macintosh.
      A <term>binary file</term> has a more general format that can store numbers and other data the way they are
       stored in the computer.      In this section we will consider only text files.
      Binary files are considered in Chapter<nbsp/>11.

    <title>File Input with the <c>File</c> and <c>Scanner</c>Classes</title>
    <p>
      An instance of the <c>java.io.File</c> class stores information that a <c>Scanner</c> object needs to create an input stream that is connected to the sequence of characters in a text file.
      A partial list of the public methods of the <c>File</c> class is given in the 
      UML class diagram in <xref ref="fig-fileuml">Figure</xref>.
      We will need to use only the <c>File()</c> constructor in this section.
</p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-fileuml">
        <caption>File UML</caption>
             <image width="40%" source="chptr11/fileuml.png"/> 
       </figure>

       <p>      The <c>File</c> instance created with the statement below
      will obtain and store information about the "riddles.txt" file in the same directory as the java code being executed,
      if such a file exists.
      If no such file exists,
      the <c>File</c> object stores information needed to create such a file but does not create it.
      In Chapter<nbsp/>11, we will describe how other objects can use a file object to create a file in which to write data.
      If we wish to create a <c>File</c> object that describes a file in a directory other than the one containing the Java program,
      we must call the constructor with a string argument that specifies the file's complete path name<mdash/>that is,
      one that lists the sequence of directories containing the file.
      In any case, while we will not use it at this time,
      the <c>exists()</c> method of a <c>File</c> instance can be used to determine whether or not a file has been found with the specified name.
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
File theFile = new File("riddles.txt");
    </input>
</program>

   
    
   
    <p>
      In order to read data from a file with a <c>Scanner</c> object we will need to use methods that were not discussed in Chapter<nbsp/>2.
      An expanded list of methods of the <c>Scanner</c> class is given in 
      <xref ref="fig-scanner2uml">Figure</xref>.
      Note the there is a <c>Scanner()</c> constructor with a
<c>File</c> object as an argument.
      Unlike the other <c>create()</c> method that was used in Chapter<nbsp/>2,
      this <c>create()</c> throws an exception that must be handled.
      The following code will create a <c>Scanner</c> object that will be connected to an input stream that can read from a file:
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-scanner2uml">
      <caption>File UML</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="chptr04/scanner2uml.png"/>
    </figure>

<program language="java">
    <input>
try
{   
  File theFile = new File("riddles.txt");
  fileScan = new Scanner(theFile);
  fileScan = fileScan.useDelimiter("\r\n");
}
catch (IOException e)
{    
  e.printStackTrace();

} //catch()
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      We will discuss the <c>try-catch</c> commands when exceptions are covered in Chapter<nbsp/>10.
      Until then, the <c>try-catch</c> structures can be copied exactly as above,
      if you wish to use a <c>Scanner</c> object for file input.
      In the code above,
      the <c>useDelimiter()</c> method has been used to set the <c>Scanner</c> object so that spaces can occur in strings that are read by the <c>Scanner</c> object.
      For the definition of a class to read riddles from a file,
      the above code belongs in a constructor method.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we create a <c>Scanner</c> object connected to a file,
      we can make a call to <c>nextInt()</c>, <c>nextDouble()</c>, or <c>next()</c> method to read,
      respectively, an integer, real number, or string from the file.
      Unlike the strategy for using a <c>Scanner</c> object to get keyboard input,
      it is suggested that you test to see if there is more data in a file before reading it.
      This can be done with the <c>hasNext()</c>, <c>hasNextInt()</c>, and <c>hasNextDouble()</c> methods.
      These methods return the value <c>true</c> if there are more data in the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program in <xref ref="fig-fileprog">Figure</xref>
      is the complete listing of a class that reads riddles from a file
        and displays them.

   public void displayRiddle(Riddle aRiddle)
   {   System.out.println(aRiddle.getQuestion());
       System.out.print("Input any letter to see answer:");
       String str = kbScan .next();  //Ignore KB input
       System.out.println(aRiddle.getAnswer());
       System.out.println();
   } // displayRiddle()
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {   RiddleFileReader rfr =
           new RiddleFileReader("riddles.txt");
       Riddle riddle = rfr.readRiddle();
       while (riddle != null)
       {   rfr.displayRiddle(riddle);

       } // while
   } //main()

    </input>
</program>
    </listing>
   
<p>Note that, in the body of the method <c>readRiddles()</c>, the statements below    
  make explicit the fact that variables that refer to objects are assigned <c>null</c> as 
  a value when they are declared. 
</p>
<program language="java">
    <input>
String ques = null;
String ans = null;
Riddle theRiddle = null;
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      The statements below  will read <c>String</c> s into the variables <c>ques</c> and <c>ans</c> only if the file contains lines of data for them.
      Otherwise the
<c>readRiddle()</c> method will return a <c>null</c> value.  The <c>main()</c> method uses this fact to terminate a <c>while</c> loop when it runs out of string data to assign to <c>Riddle</c> questions and answers.
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
if (fileScan.hasNext())
    ques = fileScan.next();
if (fileScan.hasNext())
{   ans =  fileScan.next();
    theRiddle = new Riddle(ques, ans);
}
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
     There is a separate method, <c>displayRiddle()</c> using a separate instance of
<c>Scanner</c> attached to the keyboard to display the question of a riddle before the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of the "riddles.txt" file should be a list of riddles with each question and answer on a separate line.
      For example, the following three riddles saved in a text file would form a good example to test the <c>RiddleFileReader</c> class.
    </p>
<pre>
What is black and white and red all over?
  An embarrassed zebra
What is black and white and read all over?
  A newspaper
What other word can be made with the letters of ALGORITHM?
  LOGARITHM
</pre>

    <p>
      When the <c>main()</c> method is executed,
      the user will see output in the console window that looks like:
    </p>

<pre>
What is black and white and red all over?
Input any letter to see answer: X
An embarrassed zebra
What is black and white and read all over?
Input any letter to see answer:

      Files are covered in depth in Chapter<nbsp/>11.
      Information on writing data to a file and reading data from a file without using the <c>Scanner</c> class can be found in that chapter.

<title>Self-Study Exercises</title>

        <title>NumberFileReader</title>
      <statement>
          <p>
            Using a development environment that allows user input, modify the <c>RiddleFileReader</c> class to create a program
<c>NumberFileReader</c> that opens a file named "numbers.txt" and reports the sum of the squares of the integers in the file.
            Assume that the file "numbers.txt" contains a list of integers in which each integer is on a separate line.
            The program should print the sum of the squares in the <c>System.out</c> console window.
            In this case,
            there is no need to have a method to display the data being read or a <c>Scanner</c> object connected to the keyboard.
            You will want a constructor method and a method that reads the numbers and computes the sum of squares.

          <solution>
            <p>
